The analysis of generalised Petri nets leads us to characterise deadlock situations in terms of insufficiently marked siphons. The theory of elementary siphons guides our efforts towards the development of structurally simple liveness-enforcing supervisors. Therefore, insufficiently marked siphons can be classified into elementary ones and dependent ones. The controllability of a dependent siphon can be ensured by properly supervising its elementary ones. In order to find a compact and proper set of elementary siphons for S4PR, the concept of augmented siphons is proposed. Then, the concept of max?-controlled siphons is employed, which can relax the siphon controllability condition. By explicitly controlling elementary siphons via adding monitors, a liveness-enforcing controlled system can be found. In addition, the liveness-enforcing supervisor with more permissive behaviour is obtained through the rearrangement of the output arcs of the monitors. Finally, an FMS case study is utilised to demonstrate the proposed method.","tags":["deadlock,","siphon","citas,","citeulike","referencias,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/0951192x.2013.800233","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20974bd1e09d99e4ca5ab1fc269e719a8\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Combined buffer pre-allocation and siphon control for deadlock prevention in Petri nets","authors":["Zhiming Zhang","Weimin Wu"],"year":"2011","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":"Taylor & Francis","abstract":"We study the design of deadlock prevention for a special class of flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs).

To demonstrate this policy, two subclasses of Petri nets, denoted by MRSNB and MRSANB, are defined. Furthermore, on combining buffer pre-allocation and siphon control, two deadlock prevention approaches for such FMSs are proposed.

This model (which fits well to pervasive networking environments) completely breaks the main assumptions on which MANET routing protocols are built.

In this paper we advocate context-based routing for opportunistic networks. We provide a general framework for managing and using context for taking forwarding decisions. We propose a context-based protocol (HiBOp), and compare it with popular solutions, i.e., Epidemic Routing and PROPHET. Results show that HiBOp is able to drastically reduce resource consumption.

Furthermore, this piece argues for the inclusion of multimodal representation in our literacy courses given the changes in our digital landscape and the ever-increasing multimodality of our representational and communicational means online. This research aligns with a burgeoning collection of literature, namely New Literacies (Knobel & Lankshear, 2007) and multimodality (Kress & van Leeuwen, 2001).  In addition, this research merges with \u2018traditional\u2019 print-based literacy pedagogies that argue for models of teacher learning that foreground opportunities to \u2018do\u2019 digital composition in order to more effectively prepare students for 21st century literacy skills in epistemologically diverse digital environments. A combination of discourse and multimodal analysis provides a means to couple both linguistic and semiotic data to examine how multimodal design functions in the construction of teacher identities and how the flexibility of these identities in turn work to prepare new teachers for successful transitions into public school cultures. In other words, how might the practice of multimedia production, and reflection on those processes, foster a deeper self-awareness during a time when students are moving from university settings into public schools? This article argues that multimodal text design is dialogic and purposeful with regards to constructions of teacher identities and highlights two \u2018Digital Literacy Projects,\u2019 multimodal video compositions designed and produced by preservice teachers with video editing software. The two DLPs contrast the potential for authors to stabilize and\/or improvise formations of identity, both which create opportunities to engage in praxis that merge university experiences with public school responsibilities.","tags":["image","preservice","identity","Digital","teachers","multimodality","self-fashioning","video","improvisation","moving","discourse"],"url":"http:\/\/www.digitalcultureandeducation.com\/uncategorized\/bishop-2009-html\/","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2052e43136eac73b4f9b885260e87e3a1\/stevenw","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Becoming Bishop in the Letters of Basil and Synesius: Tracing Patterns of Social Signaling across Two Full Epistolary Collections","authors":["Adam M.

It then graphically depicts each man\u2019s attested communication for two periods, before and after his becoming bishop. Such socio-rhetorical mapping affords a new perspective on the two authors. For Basil it reveals a segmented social life, in which he discussed classical culture, Nicene doctrine, and asceticism with different groups of contacts. While usually cast as a clerical\/ascetic convert, Basil continued all his segmented conversations after he was consecrated. For Synesius, rhetorical mapping showcases a mixed social life, in which he widely discussed his patronage, literary interests, and philosophy. In contrast with the prevailing portrayal of Synesius as an unbending Neo-platonist, the article shows how he interwove Christian discourse with familiar social signals after his selection as bishop. Basil and Synesius lived differing lives, but their patterns of social signaling look like related approaches to pressures faced by most fourth- and early fifth-century local notable men who became bishops.","tags":["von","Epistolographie,","Caesarea,","Synesios","Basilius","Bischof,"],"url":"http:\/\/muse.jhu.edu\/journals\/journal_of_late_antiquity\/v007\/7.2.schor.html","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f2f2c636821613711eb7d8438c64c4b3\/avs","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"North-West Church in Hippos (Sussita), Israel","authors":["Jolanta M\u0142ynarczyk","Mariusz Burdajewicz"],"year":"2005","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Two kilometres to the east of the modern kibbutz Ein Gev on the eastern shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israel there rises a picturesque mountain with the ruins of an ancient city on its top (at ca 350 m above the level of the lake).

One such technique employs a set-covering approach to optimally match emptiable siphons to critical markings.

Many deadlock prevention policies characterize the deadlock behavior of the systems in terms of siphons and utilize this characterization to avoid deadlocks. This paper develops a novel methodology to find interesting siphons for deadlock control purposes in a class of Petri nets, i.e., a system of simple sequential processes with resources . Resource circuits in an are first detected, from which, in general, a small portion of emptiable minimal siphons can be derived. The remaining emptiable ones can be found by their composition. A polynomial-time algorithm for finding the set of elementary siphons is proposed, which avoids complete siphon enumeration. It is shown that a dependent siphon can always be controlled by properly supervising its elementary siphons. A computationally efficient deadlock control policy is accordingly developed.

One of these bears an inscription mentioning Bishop Leontios, and this building will therefore be referred to as the Church of Bishop Leontios. In this article, the authors endeavour to show that the Ya'amun mosaicists were true masters of their profession. They combined motifs with a long tradition, going back to the early and middle Roman imperial age, with newly created designs that appear here for the first time. The new designs comprise a composite motif of interlocked circles and squares, which was adopted shortly thereafter in the church of Procopius at Gerasa (AD 526). On the other hand, the motif of intersecting circles forming quatrefoils is already found in Hadrian's Villa at Tivoli. This study will try to demonstrate the history and the survival of several geometric patterns from the floor mosaics of the Church of Bishop Leontios by comparisons with other examples of the same patterns from Jordan and neighbouring countries, as well as from further afield. A peculiarity of the mosaic floors in the Church of Bishop Leontios is that they are now almost purely geometrical in design as a result of iconoclasm.","tags":["2011{\\_}1","Mosaik","ByzZ","Palaestina","Arch{\\\"a}ologie"],"url":"http:\/\/openurl.ingenta.com\/content\/xref?genre=article&issn=0031-0328&volume=143&issue=1&spage=41","id":"2121","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Deadlock analysis and control based on Petri nets: A siphon approach review","authors":["YiFan Hou","Kamel Barkaoui"],"year":"2017","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["deadlock,","siphon","citas,","citeulike","referencias,","analysis,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1177\/1687814017693542","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/288252b6fe1b914cd35fe0b4d1af37071\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Presiding Episcopal Bishop-Elect Katharine Jefferts Schori","authors":["Diane Rehm","Katharine Jefferts Schori"],"year":"2006","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":"WAMU-FM","abstract":"The first woman to lead the Episcopal Church talks about divisions in the church and her vision for the future.","tags":["news","christianity","audio","2zotero","anglican","controversy","denomination","radio","religion","episcopal","international"],"url":"http:\/\/thedianerehmshow.org\/shows\/2006-06-29\/presiding-episcopal-bishop-elect-katharine-jefferts-schori","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/28771f8dd4e08c99c93df73c3847a0853\/shelley.adams","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"A siphon-based deadlock prevention policy for flexible manufacturing systems","authors":["Yi-Sheng Huang","Jenn-Huei Lin","Jyh-Tsong Lin"],"year":"2005","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"This paper present a siphon-based algorithm of deadlock prevention for a type of Petri nets called S\/sup 3\/PMR, a subclass of S\/sup 3\/PGR\/sup 2\/.

However, it is quite time-consuming or even impossible to get the complete siphon enumeration of a Petri net. This paper focuses on the deadlock prevention problems in flexible manufacturing systems that are modeled with S4PR, a general class of Petri nets. The analysis of S4PR leads us to characterize deadlock situations in terms of insufficiently marked siphons. The method proposed in this paper is an iterative approach. At each iteration, a non-max-marked siphon is computed by solving a mixed integer linear programming problem. Then the siphon is max-marked through a P-invariant by adding a monitor place. This process is carried out until no non-max-marked siphon can be found in the net. As a result all the siphons in the net are max-controlled. Then the net becomes live. Without computing all the siphons, a monitor-based liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor can be found with more permissive behavior. A number of flexible manufacturing examples are used to demonstrate the proposed methods.","tags":["deadlocks,","petri,","siphons","cites,","citas,","citeulike","nets,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00366-008-0122-1","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27b4dce2bbea724e11a9c40e30881140d\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Road trips in Geodesic Metric Spaces and Groups with Quadratic isoperimetric inequalities.","authors":["Rachel Bishop-Ross","Jon M.

Adopting a thematic approach, Hislop presents the key debates and a wide range of perspectives in knowledge management.  The book begins by presenting the epistemologies of knowledge, asking what do we mean by knowledge? How is knowledge processed within the organization, and how is this linked to human motivation.  Part 2 discusses the social and cultural issues that surround the managing and sharing of knowledge. The dynamics of knowledge sharing and knowledge generation are examined, illustrating the different aspects of the collective and shared nature of organizational knowledge. This section also looks at how knowledge processes are shaped by the conflict and politics within the organization and demonstrates how and why knowledge and power are inextricably linked. Finally, the roles of information technology in the process of knowledge management and that of HRM and culture - the human element of knowledge - are presented.  Part 3 examines how we learn and acquire knowledge and examines the debates surrounding the learning organization. Finally, the book moves away from its thematic approach to specifically examine the character and dynamics of knowledge sharing in three contemporary organizational forms: the networked\/virtual organization, global multinationals and, knowledge intensive firms and knowledge workers.","tags":["cops","km","km_text","act-km","practice","Donald_Hislop"],"url":"http:\/\/www.amazon.co.uk\/exec\/obidos\/ASIN\/0199262063\/citeulike-21","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/222f6540212cf8feff7614a04101e60e7\/wcrosbie","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Super-resolution Enhancement of Video.","authors":["Christopher M.

Its objective is to prevent a minimal siphon from being insufficiently marked. The second one, called control-induced siphon control, is to add a control place to the augmented net with its output arcs connecting to the source transitions, which assures that there are no new insufficiently marked siphons generated. At each iteration, a mixed integer programming approach is adopted for generalised Petri nets to obtain an insufficiently marked minimal siphon from the maximal deadly siphon.

This paper proposes an algorithm to iteratively extract a set of elementary siphons in a class of Petri nets, called system of simple sequential processes with resources (S3PR). At each iteration, by a mixed-integer programming (MIP) method, the proposed algorithm finds a maximal unmarked siphon, classifies the places in it, extracts an elementary siphon from the classified places, and adds a new constraint in order to extract the next elementary siphon. This algorithm iteratively executes until no new unmarked siphons can be found. It finally obtains a unique set of elementary siphons and avoids a complete siphon enumeration. A theoretical analysis and examples are given to demonstrate its efficiency and practical potentials.","tags":["cerrojos,","siphons","extraction,","citas,","citeulike","referencias,","computation,","elementary,","calculo,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s11518-012-5188-z","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21667a84b9ec7312682aafcaf9c69327a\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"IPCop kompakt","authors":["Marco Sondermann"],"year":"2008","editors":null,"isbn":"9783939316411","publisher":"Bomots Verlag","abstract":null,"tags":["noTag"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2dca85c2add5e370aeb491df16434926a\/imtm","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Black-box optimization benchmarking of IPOP-saACM-ES and BIPOP-saACM-ES on the BBOB-2012 noiseless testbed.","authors":["Ilya Loshchilov","Marc Schoenauer","Mich\u00e8le Sebag"],"year":"2012","editors":["Terence Soule","Jason H.

In this research, a mixed integer programming (MIP)-based deadlock detection technique is used to find an insufficiently marked minimal siphon from a maximal deadly marked siphon for generalized Petri nets. In addition, two-stage control method is employed for deadlock prevention in Petri net model. Such proposed method is an iterative approach consisting of two stages. The first one is called siphons control , which adds a control place to the original net for each insufficiently marked minimal siphon. The objective is to prevent minimal siphons from being insufficiently marked. The second one, called control-induced siphons control , is to add a control place to the augmented net with its output arcs connecting to source transitions, which assures that there is no new insufficiently marked siphon generated due to the addition of the monitors. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed deadlock prevention policy can usually lead to a non-blocking supervisor with more permissive behavior and high computational efficiency for a sizeable plant model due to avoiding complete siphon enumeration.

By modifying the objective function and adding new constraints to the mixed-integer programming (MIP) method proposed by Park and Reveliotis, this paper presents a revised MIP (RMIP) to directly solve siphons, called smart siphons, with the minimal cardinality as well as the minimal number of resource places. Accordingly, an iterative siphon-based control (ISC) method adds a proper control place (CP) to make each smart siphon max-controlled until the controlled system is live. Since any siphon that has more resource places can be composed of those containing less resource places, a small number of CPs are required during the iterative control process due to the solved smart siphons containing the minimal number of resource places. Compared with the existing methods in the literature, the proposed ISC method using the RMIP avoids computing a maximal deadly marked siphon from which a minimal siphon is then derived, adds a small number of proper CPs, and leads to a liveness-enforcing supervisor with a simple structure.

In the Petri net framework, deadlock prevention is often addressed by siphon-based control (SC) policies. Recent research results show that SC methods can avoid full siphon enumeration by using mixed integer programming (MIP) to greatly increase the computational efficiency so that it can be applied in large systems in computable time. Besides, maximally permissive control solutions can be obtained by means of iterative siphon control (ISC) approaches and MIP. Then the remaining problems are redundancy and MIP iterations. Redundant controllers make the closed-loop system more complicated and each MIP iteration increases the total computational time. This article proposes a revised ISC deadlock prevention policy which can achieve better results than the other reported methods in terms of redundancy and MIP iterations while maintaining the maximal permissiveness.

First, we replace the classical partition of the event set into controllable and uncontrollable events from supervisory control theory, by associating a control and observation cost to each event. This leads naturally to formulate the supervisory control problem as an optimal control problem. Monitor places which enforce the constraint are devised as a solution of an integer linear programming problem whose objective function is expressed in terms of the introduced costs. Second, we consider timed models for which the monitor choice may lead to performance optimization. If the plant net belongs to the class of mono-T-semiflow nets, we present an integer linear fractional programming approach to synthesize the optimal monitor so as to minimize the cycle time lower bound of the closed loop net.

MIT Press","abstract":"The desire to move viewers out of the role of passive observers and into the role of producers is one of the hallmarks of twentieth-century art. This tendency can be found in practices and projects ranging from El Lissitzky's exhibition designs to Allan Kaprow's happenings, from minimalist objects to installation art. More recently, this kind of participatory art has gone so far as to encourage and produce new social relationships. Guy Debord's celebrated argument that capitalism fragments the social bond has become the premise for much relational art seeking to challenge and provide alternatives to the discontents of contemporary life. This publication collects texts that place this artistic development in historical and theoretical context. Participation begins with writings that provide a theoretical framework for relational art, with essays by Umberto Eco, Bertolt Brecht, Roland Barthes, Peter B\u00fcrger, Jen-Luc Nancy, Edoaurd Glissant, and F\u00e9lix Guattari, as well as the first translation into English of Jacques Ranci\u00e8re's influential \"Problems and Transformations in Critical Art.\" The book also includes central writings by such artists as Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica, Joseph Beuys, Augusto Boal, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Thomas Hirschhorn, and Rirkrit Tiravanija.

Theory and evidence is presented to suggest that knowledge sharing between communities is likely to be more complex than intra-community knowledge sharing, due to the lack of shared consensual knowledge or shared sense of identity, which typically exists in inter-community contexts.  In such situations, the development of trust is seen to be a key foundation, which requires to be developed before effective knowledge sharing can occur.  Three brief case studies are presented to illustrate the arguments made.  Practitioner implications flowing from this chapter are twofold.  Firstly, to facilitate effective inter-community knowledge sharing requires effort to be invested in developing the social relationship (and hence trust) between members from the communities.  Secondly, organizations need to balance their efforts at building Communities of Practice, with supporting inter-community interactions, otherwise they risk developing isolated and inward looking communities.","tags":["KM","CoP","Trust","Reciprocity","Community_of_Practice","Change_Management","Knowledge_Management","Knowledge_Process","Group_Performance","Inter-Community_Communication","Consensual_Knowledge","Tacit_Knowledge","Case_Study","Identity","Knowledge_Sharing"],"url":"http:\/\/www.chris-kimble.com\/KNICOP\/Chapters\/Chapter_4.html","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a5427824312ccceadb633be3b64b4732\/xckuk","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Mechanical stimulation of bone healing","authors":["Nicholas Bishop"],"year":"2006","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["dnb","Gesundheit","Medizin"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22c8f17cb5742882e78aaa986d974ac34\/genealogie","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Education in information security","authors":["M.

This paper presents an iterative siphon-based control (ISC) deadlock prevention policy for Petri nets via the combination of mixed integer programming (MIP) and the concept of necessary siphons (NSs). At each iteration in this ISC policy, a maximal deadly marked siphon that is closely related to deadlocks in a Petri net can be conveniently found by an MIP-based deadlock detection method. Then the places in it are classified and an NS is derived from the classified places. For each NS found, depending on its complementary set, the proposed policy adds a proper control place (CP) to make it marked (max-controlled). Moreover, during the ISC procedure, a test for redundant NSs is carried out under a certain condition in order to avoid the addition of the corresponding CPs. The siphon control process proceeds iteratively until the controlled system is live. Compared with the existing approaches, the proposed policy usually leads to a structurally simple liveness-enforcing supervisor by adding as few CPs as possible and achieves better control results. Some examples are introduced to illustrate the proposed approach.","tags":["deadlock,","citas,","citeulike","liveness,","referencias","fms,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10845-012-0647-4","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2923fe51866641349d0b0600481cbae70\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"New Algorithms for Deciding the Siphon-Trap Property.","authors":["Olivia Oanea","Harro Wimmel","Karsten Wolf"],"year":"2010","editors":["Johan Lilius","Wojciech Penczek"],"isbn":"978-3-642-13674-0","publisher":"Springer","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/apn\/pn2010.html#OaneaWW10","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/285b7acc60d8b0a468fc4c465ea0b0785\/dblp","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"HiPReP: High-Performance Reconfigurable Processor - Architecture and Compiler.","authors":["Philipp S.

Community informatics (CI) is an emerging field of interdisciplinary scholarship and practice devoted to enabling communities with information and communications technologies (ICTs). CI research is conducted internationally in settings that range from inner-city neighborhoods to rural villages, exploring how individuals and institutions such as schools, libraries, grassroots groups and health agencies come together to develop capacity and work on common problems. CI is increasingly calling for research that recognizes the ability of even the most impoverished communities to conduct inquiry and use appropriate ICTs in ways that respect local meanings and goals. University-based research in CI also encompasses collaboration with community organizations and residents.

Many of these are conserved in related species and act on target mRNAs by sequence complementarity. They are tightly controlled at the transcription level, and are frequently elements of global regulatory systems. In Escherichia coli and Salmonella, almost one third of the functional characterized sRNAs participate in control of outer membrane protein production. A subset of these genes is under the control of the sigma(E)-signalling system that monitors the folding status of the envelope and interacts with other regulatory systems to integrate multiple signals into a coordinated cellular response. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology, Moon and Gottesman describe a novel baseparing sRNA that participates in modulation of bacterial surface properties by regulating lipopolysaccharide modification. The small RNA is expressed as part of the PhoP\/PhoQ two-component system that plays a major role in virulence of pathogenic species. This work expands the list of global regulators known to control small RNA expression in enterobacteria and reinforces the idea that one central role of bacterial small regulatory RNAs is to modulate and fine-tune cell surface composition and structure.","tags":["bacterial_surface"],"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19906183?dopt=Abstract","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d139c8d1311e9add2d68d615adba67f2\/penkib","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"HIPPO - A Declarative Graphical Modelling System.","authors":["Chris J.

Siphons in such a plant Petri net model are divided into elementary and dependent ones. Our policy consists of two stages: siphon control and control-induced siphon control. At first stage, a monitor (control place) is added for each elementary siphon such that it is invariant-controlled. Due to the addition of monitors to plant model, control-induced siphons are possibly generated in the augmented S\/sup 3\/PR which is an RCN-merged net. The second stage sees that monitors are added to make always marked control-induced siphons in the resultant RCN-merged net without generating new control-induced siphons. Compared with our previous work, the deadlock prevention policy developed in this paper can lead to a structurally simple liveness-enforcing Petri net supervisor by adding only a small number of monitors and arcs. A flexible manufacturing systems (FMS) example is utilized to illustrate the proposed methods.","tags":["supervisory","deadlock,","citas,","citeulike"],"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpls\/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=1600770","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22dcc22dcdfc4cde9b55a6f1aaf6a960b\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Methods and Tools for the Verification of Critical Properties.","authors":["Roger Bishop Jones"],"year":"1992","editors":["Cliff B.

He challenges the common assumption that bishops split between 'Nicenes' and 'non-Nicenes', 'Arians' or 'Eusebians'. Instead, he argues that questions of doctrine took second place to disputes about the status of individual bishops and broader issues of the role of ecclesiastical councils, the nature of episcopal authority, and in particular the supremacy of the bishop of Rome. Canon law allows the author to offer a fresh understanding of the purposes of councils in the East after 337 particularly the famed Dedication Council of 341 and the western meeting of the council of Serdica and the canon law written there, which elevated the bishop of Rome to an authority above all other bishops. Investigating the laws they wrote, the author describes the power struggles taking place in the years following 337 as bishops sought to elevate their status and grasp the opportunity for the absolute form of leadership Constantine had embodied. Combining a close study of the laws and events of this period with broader reflections on the nature of power and authority in the Church and the increasingly important role of canon law, the book offers a fresh narrative of one of the most significant periods in the development of the Church as an institution and of the bishop as a leader.","tags":["Synode_von_Antiochien","Canones","Synode_von_Serdika"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27e821e52f84f303803d300050133710d\/avs","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Functions of Baire Class One over a Bishop Topology.","authors":["Iosif Petrakis"],"year":"2020","editors":["Marcella Anselmo","Gianluca Della Vedova","Florin Manea","Arno Pauly"],"isbn":"978-3-030-51466-2","publisher":"Springer","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/cie\/cie2020.html#Petrakis20","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26574618e39ff4da742b3916e9b2baa5d\/dblp","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Automated landmarking and geometric characterization of the carotid siphon","authors":["Hrvoje Bogunovic","Jose M Pozo","Ruben Cardenes","Maria Cruz Villa-Uriol","Raphael Blanc","Michel Piotin","Alejandro F.

The predicted association between poor skill with the non-preferred hand and left-handedness was confirmed for the match-sorting test, and was particularly strong among children with a neurological abnormality (excluding cerebral palsy). No association between poor skill and left-handedness was found for the preferred hand. The data agreed well with a model which estimates hand preference it it occurs on the previously preferred side. The probability of pathological left-handedness among left-handers in an unselected population is about 0.05--this is much higher for children with a history of neurological disease, epilepsy or mental retardation, and for children with poor performance of the non-preferred hand.","tags":["Mental","Disorders;","Child;","Humans;","Psychological","Brain","Laterality;","Motor","Tests;","Cerebral","Damage,","Psychomotor","Epilepsy;","Cognition","Skills;","Functional","Retardation;","Palsy;","Development;","Dyslexia;","Child","Chronic;","Perfo;","rmance"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2145d433306a73afc45f034455a81ecde\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Dynamics-based Control of Robotic Swarms.","authors":["Bradley E.

This \u201cZombie Renaissance\u201d demonstrates increased dread concerning violent death\u2014via terrorist attacks or contagious infection\u2014and establishes the currency of a critical investigation into this oft-maligned subgenre. The zombie narrative has particular value to American cultural studies as the creature was born on the shores of the New World, rather than being co-opted\r\n from the Old, and it functions as a symbolic reminder of the trocities of colonialism and slavery. Drawing on ethnographic studies of Haitian folklore, the voodoo-based zombie films of the 1930s and \u201940s do crucial cultural work in their own right, revealing deep-seated racist attitudes and imperialist paranoia, but the zombie invasion narrative established by George A. Romero has even greater singularity. Having no established literary analogue, Romero borrowed instead from voodoo mythology, vampire tales, and science fiction invasion narratives to develop a new tradition with Night of the Living Dead in 1968. His conception of a contagious, cannibalistic zombie horde uniquely manifests modern apprehensions about \r\nthe horrors of Vietnam, the struggles of the Civil Rights Movement, and, in the more \r\nrecent films, the problems of excessive consumerism and the anxieties of both the Cold War and the current War on Terror. Essentially, zombies work as powerful metaphors for modern-day society and the prevailing cultural unease surrounding violent death and the loss of autonomous subjectivity, and, as recent production proves, the subgenre will continue to serve the viewing public as it grows, mutates, and evolves.","tags":["zombie","film"],"url":"http:\/\/arizona.openrepository.com\/arizona\/bitstream\/10150\/194727\/1\/azu_etd_10498_sip1_m.pdf","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20af639dc88b33465489fb15b3038bca0\/grado","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Gossip-based distributed data fusion of empirical probability measures.","authors":["Adrian N.

Chao"],"year":"2010","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":"Taylor & Francis","abstract":"Abstract A siphon is an important structure object for deadlock control. Insufficiently marked siphons lead to deadlocks. Deadlock occurs due to inappropriate resource sharing. Hence most of the research focuses on the minimal siphon extraction problem covering a set of places representing resources, which, for general Petri Nets is known to be an NP?Complete problem. Control places and arcs are often added to the original net to prevent a siphon from becoming insufficiently marked. The number of siphons grows rapidly with the size of the net leading to very complicated control nets. Efficient enumeration of problematic siphons is an urgent research topic. Earlier, we proposed fast algorithms to find all such siphons for both S3PR and S2CPR (System of Synchronized Choice Processes with Resources). However, it was assumed that siphons occur between adjacent processes. This paper removes this assumption and develops an algorithm for S3PMR which is more powerful than S3PR by allowing a state to use more than one resource and than S2CPR by allowing more than one state to use the same resources. Comparisons with previously published work have been made.","tags":["petri,","siphons","extraction,","minimal,","citeulike","redes,","de,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/02533839.2010.9671688","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ec17021c0487b04daba773cc4f4a7254\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Universal features in the classical statistical mechanics for a class\r\n\tof continuum-field nonlinear Hamiltonians","authors":["A.

Bishop"],"year":"2013","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":"The Royal Society","abstract":"Several decades of research in the field of machine learning have resulted in a multitude of different algorithms for solving a broad range of problems. To tackle a new application, a researcher typically tries to map their problem onto one of these existing methods, often influenced by their familiarity with specific algorithms and by the availability of corresponding software implementations. In this study, we describe an alternative methodology for applying machine learning, in which a bespoke solution is formulated for each new application. The solution is expressed through a compact modelling language, and the corresponding custom machine learning code is then generated automatically. This model-based approach offers several major advantages, including the opportunity to create highly tailored models for specific scenarios, as well as rapid prototyping and comparison of a range of alternative models. Furthermore, newcomers to the field of machine learning do not have to learn about the huge range of traditional methods, but instead can focus their attention on understanding a single modelling environment. In this study, we show how probabilistic graphical models, coupled with efficient inference algorithms, provide a very flexible foundation for model-based machine learning, and we outline a large-scale commercial application of this framework involving tens of millions of users. We also describe the concept of probabilistic programming as a powerful software environment for model-based machine learning, and we discuss a specific probabilistic programming language called Infer.NET, which has been widely used in practical applications.","tags":["bayes","machine_learning"],"url":"http:\/\/rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org\/content\/371\/1984\/20120222","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/205a771603c4017923874d33ee933e0e0\/loroch","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Editorial.","authors":["Martin J.

By drawing attention to the different traditions present in the sources and by eliminating some conceptual misgivings concerning episcopal exiles, this paper shows that the numerous depositions of Cyril attested during the reigns of Julian and Valens reflect a battle for supremacy between Cyril and his Homoean opponents. It cannot be proven that Cyril was really exiled or even deposed during this period. The internal battle for the see of Jerusalem continued when Cyril, previously a member of the Homoiousian party, accepted the Nicene orthodoxy under Theodosius I. This time the  true' Nicenes regretted Cyril's opportunistic conversion and did not accept him as the true bishop of the city.

Is it even possible to arrive at a reasonably trustworthy picture of the Christians in question, including their religious practices, everyday life, and socio-cultural environment? Which questions occupied them and their bishop?In the homilies on Acts, we possess a portion of John Chrysostom\u2019s extensive oeuvre that enables a rather unvarnished picture of the preacher and his audience. That is so because the homilies have been transmitted in an unedited state, as Chrysostom delivered them, because they were delivered successively during the course of half a year (400-401 AD), and because we know the political situation in Constantinople at that time quite well. Acts has a special place within the New Testament not because its subject is the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus directly, but rather because it is where Luke the Evangelist relates the origins of the Church and, in particular, how the disciples of Jesus began to proclaim and live out their faith. When a cohesive series of sermons takes this biblical book as its subject, that series is bound to mirror something of the faith and life of the community that hears the homilies, and of the bishop who delivers them. This thesis will be tested using several texts from the homilies on Acts. It turns out that the person of Peter, as he is known to us from Acts, is the model for the community leader, bishop, and preacher, and that the first community in Jerusalem is fashioned into a model for the Christians in Constantinople, especially with regard to their moral comportment. This \u201cmirror,\u201d then, provides us with a view of the metropolitan community: it consists predominately of Christians from the rich, educated upper class, who take their Christianity seriously enough to attend religious services daily. The task of bishop John Chrysostom is so to influence their practical life, by means of concrete guidance, that more of the Kingdom of God becomes visible in the Christian community.","tags":["Johannes_Chrysostomos"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c48006c55fff5c96b0a6bcfc6dddfaac\/avs","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Emerging Communities: Integrating Networked Information into Library Services, 1993 Clinic on Library Applications of Data Processing, April 4--6, Graduate School of Library and Information Science","authors":null,"year":"1993","editors":["A.P.

The usage of this uncommon verb in Greek literature is discussed, as it has cultural and religious implications relating to the religious milieu of Socrates\u2019 time. Christian authors used \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 disparagingly and linked it to heresy and dilettantism. However, Socrates Scholasticus used this verb to describe the literary activity of the Novatian bishop Sisinnius, an apparently contradictory use of \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 prompted by the historian\u2019s sympathy for Novatianism. My working assumption is that Socrates used \u03bb\u03b5\u03be\u03b9\u03b8\u03b7\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 as a stylistic term and applied it to Sisinnius in order to portray him as a learned bishop capable of competing with other well-educated bishops.","tags":["Sokrates"],"url":"http:\/\/www.degruyter.com\/view\/j\/phil.2014.158.issue-2\/phil-2014-0017\/phil-2014-0017.xml","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a15048287beb55ae0cf76e4b6af4878f\/avs","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Augustinus von Hippo - Regel f\u00fcr die Gemeinschaft","authors":[" van Bavel, J.

In a previous study, Shapiro et al. (1997) Hippocampus 7:624-642, suggested that hippocampal place cell firing is controlled by distal cues and proximal floor inserts in a flexible and hierarchical fashion. Control exerted by the combined set of cues prevailed over control by distal cues, which itself prevailed over control by proximal cues. Here, we examined the generality of this hierarchy in the use of cues. Place cells were recorded as rats performed a pellet chasing task on a platform containing three proximal objects, surrounded by a curtain where three visual stimuli were hung. A double rotation of distal and proximal cue sets producing a 180 degrees mismatch revealed noncoherent responses of place cells. Most fields were controlled by the configuration of proximal and distal cues (i.e., remapped). Less often, fields were controlled by specific cues with a majority being controlled by proximal cues, thus suggesting that response hierarchy is modulated by the environment. We finally examined the effect of removing one set of cues after the double rotation session. Half of the fields were controlled by the remaining cues while the other half remapped, thus suggesting a competition between pattern completion and pattern separation processes. Furthermore, cells that were controlled by the remaining cues were mainly those that had remapped in the double rotation session. Our results are compatible with the idea that the flexibility of the place cell system results from an interaction between the sensory properties of individual cell and the attractor networks properties of the whole place cell population.","tags":["cells","hippocampus","place"],"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17372978","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22259e773a749243a2a7cbf520f0973bd\/butz","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Inconsistency in deception for defense.","authors":["Vicentiu Neagoe","Matt Bishop"],"year":"2006","editors":["Christian Hempelmann","Victor Raskin"],"isbn":"978-1-59593-923-4","publisher":"ACM","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/nspw\/nspw2006.html#NeagoeB06","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d9d669f32b591000425ce22e7b0e87d8\/dblp","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Computer-Mediated Communication as Employee Voice: The Profit Sharing Plan.","authors":["Libby Bishop","David Levine"],"year":"1993","editors":["Andrew Clement","Paul Kolm","Ina Wagner"],"isbn":"0-444-81720-4","publisher":"North-Holland","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/networking\/networking1993.html#BishopL93","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c53323f56cdcad55697d1cf6c8cfb09a\/dblp","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"An Introduction to the Kalman Filter","authors":["Greg Welch","Gary Bishop"],"year":"1995","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill","abstract":null,"tags":["kalman"],"url":"http:\/\/www.cs.unc.edu\/~welch\/kalman\/kalmanIntro.html","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/289a06c7bd0a07a66f5654fc4cc36d03a\/stefano","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Understanding magnetization losses in terms of eddy current dominated domain wall dynamics","authors":["J.

The influence of domain wall surface tension on domain wall dynamics is discussed with special attention to the orientation dependence of wall energy in crystals with positive cubic anisotropy. Numerical calculations of eddy current and surface tension dominated domain wall motion based on segmented model walls are discussed and compared with experimental evidence. Good agreement is found with the recent work of Narita and Imamura on (100) 001 oriented 4% SiFe.

Using relatively common assumptions, it is\n                 shown that the average value of the failure rate of the\n                 program, after a particular use-time, t, is bounded by\n                 N\/(e\/spl middot\/t), where N is the initial number of\n                 faults.

We review the current literature on path integration and its interaction with external, location-based cues.

As new neurons have been linked to hippocampal functions, such as cognition, age-related decline in new neuron formation may contribute to impaired hippocampal function. We investigated whether a rewarding experience known to stimulate neurogenesis in young adult rats, namely sexual experience, would restore new neuron production and hippocampal function in middle-aged rats. Sexual experience enhanced the number of newly generated neurons in the dentate gyrus with both single and repeated exposures in middle-aged rats. Following continuous long-term exposure to sexual experience, cognitive function was improved. However, when a prolonged withdrawal period was introduced between the final mating experience and behavioral testing, the improvements in cognitive function were lost despite the presence of more new neurons. Taken together, these results suggest that repeated sexual experience can stimulate adult neurogenesis and restore cognitive function in the middle-aged rat as long as the experience persists throughout the testing period. The extent to which changes in adult neurogenesis underlie those in cognition remain unknown. \ufffd 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","tags":["sex","neurogenesis","adult","brain"],"url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/23460298","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27509a8e3ecab8d0e9e5b70ee69d6a690\/bjoern","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Siphon-based deadlock prevention policy for interorganizational WorkFlow net design.","authors":["Luciane de Fatima Silva","L\u00edgia Maria Soares Passos","Michel dos Santos Soares","St\u00e9phane Julia"],"year":"2013","editors":null,"isbn":"978-1-4799-1050-2","publisher":"IEEE Computer Society","abstract":null,"tags":["dblp"],"url":"http:\/\/dblp.uni-trier.de\/db\/conf\/iri\/iri2013.html#SilvaPSJ13","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/204784a54f53091e0ad1149f6d8943190\/dblp","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Dynamic Power Management for Embedded Systems","authors":["Bishop Brock","Karthrick Rajamani"],"year":"2003","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["DPM_Embedded"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2df94eee1cc985f52490b226b4d9ad818\/rekstorm","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Integrated problem resolution for business communications","authors":["C.

First, we find siphons that need to be controlled using a mixed integer programming (MIP) method. This way avoids complete siphon enumeration that is more time-consuming for a sizable plant model than the MIP method. Monitors are added for only those siphons that require them. Second, we rearrange the output arcs of the monitors on condition that liveness is still preserved. The liveness is verified by an MIP-based deadlock detection method instead of much time-consuming reachability analysis. Experimental studies show that the proposed approach is more efficient than the existing ones and can result in more permissive and structurally simpler liveness-enforcing supervisors than all the known existing methods.

Here, we present an integrative personal omics profile (iPOP), an analysis that combines genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14 month period. Our iPOP analysis revealed various medical risks, including type 2 diabetes. It also uncovered extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. Extremely high-coverage genomic and transcriptomic data, which provide the basis of our iPOP, revealed extensive heteroallelic changes during healthy and diseased states and an unexpected RNA editing mechanism. This study demonstrates that longitudinal iPOP can be used to interpret healthy and diseased states by connecting genomic information with additional dynamic omics activity.

V. Bishop","J. Robson"],"year":"1989","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Previous work has shown that children with motor speech disorders (dysarthria) have no particular difficulty in spelling non-words containing sounds that they cannot produce accurately in their own speech. This suggests that subvocal articulation is not implicated in generating a graphemic representation from a phonological string. However, it could be argued that, although severely unintelligible, dysarthric individuals may be able to use their own articulation as a basis for translating between phonemes and graphemes. In this study we investigated spelling of words and non-words in cerebral palsied individuals, including speechless (anarthric) as well as dysarthric subjects. Although spelling abilities of these individuals were below control levels, there was no evidence that different processes were used, and one anarthric individual achieved perfect performance in spelling a list of non-words which included consonant clusters. It is concluded that spelling by the 'indirect' route can be achieved in the absence of any articulation.","tags":["Disorders;","Child;","Humans;","Vocabulary","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Verbal","Learning;","Articulation","Palsy;","Female;","Semantics;","Phonetics;","Speech","Dysarthria;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2915a862ac0c8b0632bbf4ce48c4b3e23\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Analysis of Numerical Methods","authors":["Eugene Isaacson","Herbert Bishop Keller"],"year":"1994","editors":null,"isbn":"0486680290 9780486680293","publisher":"Dover Publications","abstract":null,"tags":["textbook","numerical.analysis","chebyshev.set","haar","matrix"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/24b8f390b831c35411b83bf18014832db\/ytyoun","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Explicit Explore, Exploit, or Escape (E4): near-optimal safety-constrained reinforcement learning in polynomial time.","authors":["David M.

Low-income families, sexual minorities and African-American women are represented in the three studies that employ different research approaches towards a common aim of contextualizing internet use in the everyday social practice of society's `have-nots'. The aim is to step outside simple digital divide categories to understand how marginalized members of society incorporate computers and the internet into their daily lives in ways that are meaningful to them. An important goal is also to learn about how internet researchers can contribute to closing the digital divide in ways that converge with the goals, meanings and practices of people living on society's margins.

The formalism makes no presuppositions about the representation of primitive data structures and control structures. Such structures can be programmed, micro-coded, or hard wired in a uniform modular fashion. In fact it is impossible to determine whether a given object is \"really\" represented as a list, a vector, a hash table, a function, or a process. The architecture will efficiently run the coming generation of PLANNER-like artificial intelligence languages including those requiring a high degree of parallelism. The efficiency is gained without loss of programming generality because it only makes certain actors more efficient; it does not change their behavioral characteristics. The architecture is general with respect to control structure and does not have or need goto, interrupt, or semaphore primitives. The formalism achieves the goals that the disallowed constructs are intended to achieve by other more structured methods.","tags":["Actors","Formalism"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27523c4d95249f999c27701f446714085\/gron","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Abstraction, Design, and Theory in Computer Science: A Liberal Arts Course.","authors":["James D.

They partition siphons into elementary and dependent ones. The controllability of the latter can be ensured by the former's proper control. They give a sufficient condition to decide whether a dependent siphon is controlled by its elementary ones in S 3 PR. However, this condition is so loose that in many cases the controllability of a dependent SMS cannot be determined although it is actually controlled. In this paper, we propose an improved condition to decide the controllability of strongly dependent SMS.","tags":["petri,","resource,","supervisory","siphons,","citas,","citeulike","nets,","control,","allocation,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/icnsc.2011.5874938","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26c23555fab7bf473a62c8abb93deafae\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"The anti-Pelagian Christology of Augustine of Hippo, 396 - 430","authors":["Dominic Keech"],"year":"2012","editors":null,"isbn":"978-0-19-966223-4","publisher":"Oxford Univ.

Mounting pressure from increasing tuition costs and free, online course offerings\r\nis opening discussion and catalyzing change in the physical classroom. The flipped classroom is\r\nat the center of this discussion. The flipped classroom is a new pedagogical method, which employs\r\nasynchronous video lectures and practice problems as homework, and active, group-based\r\nproblem solving activities in the classroom. It represents a unique combination of learning theories\r\nonce thought to be incompatible\u2014active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a\r\nconstructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded\r\nupon behaviorist principles.\r\nThis paper provides a comprehensive survey of prior and ongoing research of the flipped classroom.\r\nStudies are characterized on several dimensions. Among others, these include the type of\r\nin-class and out-of-class activities, the measures used to evaluate the study, and methodological\r\ncharacteristics for each study. Results of this survey show that most studies conducted to date\r\nexplore student perceptions and use single-group study designs. Reports of student perceptions\r\nof the flipped classroom are somewhat mixed, but are generally positive overall. Students tend\r\nto prefer in-person lectures to video lectures, but prefer interactive classroom activities over lectures.\r\nAnecdotal evidence suggests that student learning is improved for the flipped compared\r\nto traditional classroom. However, there is very little work investigating student learning outcomes\r\nobjectively. We recommend for future work studies investigating of objective learning\r\noutcomes using controlled experimental or quasi-experimental designs. We also recommend that\r\nresearchers carefully consider the theoretical framework used to guide the design of in-class activities.","tags":["flipped","classroom"],"url":"http:\/\/www.asee.org\/file_server\/papers\/attachment\/file\/0003\/3259\/6219.pdf","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a07dd1b9ba20c7bc7d5651c0f7563d65\/yish","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Using the Web to support inquiry-based literacy development.

This research forms part of a\n                 study aimed at reducing the costs associated with\n                 developing intelligent programming tutors by inducing\n                 solutions to the programming problems presented to\n                 students, instead of requiring the lecturer to provide\n                 these solutions. The paper proposes a GP system for the\n                 induction of algorithms using iteration and nested\n                 iteration. The proposed system was tested on 15\n                 randomly selected novice procedural programming\n                 problems requiring the use of iterative and\n                 nested-iterative constructs. The system was able to\n                 evolve solutions to eight of these problems. Premature\n                 convergence of the GP algorithm as a result of fitness\n                 function biases was identified as the cause of the\n                 failure of the system to induce solutions to the\n                 remaining seven problems. The iterative structure-based\n                 algorithm (ISBA) was developed and successfully\n                 implemented to escape local optima caused by fitness\n                 function biases and evolve solutions to these\n                 problems.","tags":["genetic","algorithms,","programming"],"url":"http:\/\/www.cs.ukzn.ac.za\/publications\/nelishia_c37.pdf","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d475dd6b8e5459f68c38c864c0fc9de4\/brazovayeye","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Why Robots Play Soccer (Keynote Extended Abstract)","authors":["Kurt Geihs"],"year":"2006","editors":["Trish Alexander Judith Bishop"],"isbn":null,"publisher":"ACM","abstract":null,"tags":["itegpub"],"url":"http:\/\/www.vs.uni-kassel.de\/publications\/2006\/Gei06","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/24b2c6a8ba9228c503613321419688c46\/tweise_iteg","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"A Case of Visitor versus Interpreter Pattern.","authors":["Mark Hills","Paul Klint","Tijs van der Storm","Jurgen J.

A descriptive research approach was employed to accomplish the aim of this paper. Findings are that avoidance IT security consideration is the least covered by legal prescripts, while the deterrence IT security consideration is comprehensively covered by legal prescripts. While legal prescripts related to deterrence IT security consideration are almost similar, they prescribe different punishments for the same violation. A further study is needed to establish whether IT security considerations not covered by legal prescripts are mitigated by other means, and a different further study to determine the efficacy of deterrence without detection is also needed. A consolidated IT security legal prescript might deliver a better remedy to prevailing disjointedness and duplications.

The streamline upwind finite element method is used for the analysis of thermal viscous flow in the fluid region, whereas the analysis of heat conduction in solid region is performed by the Galerkin method. The method uses the three-node triangular element with equal-order interpolation functions for all the variables of the velocity components, the pressure and the temperature. The main advantage of the proposed method is to consistently couple heat transfer along the fluid-solid interface. Three test cases, i.e. conjugate Couette flow problem in parallel plate channel, counter-flow in heat exchanger, and conjugate natural convection in a square cavity with a conducting wall, are selected to evaluate the efficiency of the present method.","tags":["conjugate-heat-transfer","65m60-pdes-ibvps-finite-elements","80m10-heat-transfer-finite-element-methods"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s10409-005-0060-8","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2233ac6a28f14d5d77d3a0e7ccab021d0\/gdmcbain","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Procedure Calling and Structured Architecture.","authors":["Judy M.

In this paper, siphons in a generalized Petri net are classified into elementary and dependent ones, as done for ordinary nets in our previous work. Conditions are derived under which a dependent siphon is controlled by properly supervising its elementary siphons, which indicates that the controllability of dependent siphons in an ordinary Petri net is a special case of that in a generalized one. The application of the controllability of dependent siphons is shown by considering the deadlock prevention problem for a class of resource allocation systems, namely, G-system that allows multiple resource acquisitions and flexible routings in a flexible manufacturing system with machining, assembly, and disassembly operations. We develop a monitor-based deadlock prevention policy that first adds monitors for elementary siphons only to a G-system plant model such that the resultant net system satisfies the maximal controlled-siphon property (maximal cs-property). Then, by linear programming, initial tokens in the additional monitors are decided such that liveness is enforced to the supervised system. Also, a simplified live marking relationship for a G-system between the initial tokens of the source places and those of the resource places is derived. Finally, the proposed deadlock prevention methods are illustrated by using an example. <\/para>","tags":["cerrojos,","prevention,","petri,","siphons","deadlock,","citas,","citeulike","nets,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1109\/tsmca.2007.914741","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20e02081b9c2f8d38211de458dbecddde\/fernand0","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"Das akakianische Schisma: Liberatus, Breviarium 15-18","authors":["Hanns Christof Brennecke"],"year":"2010","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"The analysis of Breviarium 15-18 shows the pro-chalcedonian, Western position of Liberatus.

Nicholas, bishop of Modru\u0161, a member of the cardinal's entourage, published immediately a short funeral oration which became quite popular during the papacy of Sixtus IV. Nicholas's oration modestly hides its humanist learning, explicitly citing only the Bible, although the sources of ideas and expressions in the oration include also Cicero, Horace, Lorenzo Valla, Plato, Firmicus Maternus, Aristotle, Augustine, Seneca, Petrus Damiani, Sidonius Apollinaris, Terence. A further group of linguistic parallels in the oration consists of memorable, notable phrases whose sources cannot be unambiguously identified. We list eleven examples of such phrases and their occurrences in other Latin texts (dicturus igitur; extremum amici munus; vel praestare possim vel polliceri; praecipuus fautor, cultor bonorum, curiae splendor, ornamentum civitatis; puerili aetate, virili tamen sensu; ipsa veritate verius; honesta hospitia; officiorum vicissitudine; lacrimis suffusum oculos; Simoniacae perfidiae praemia; caduca mundi felicitas; further 13 memorable collocations for which parallels were also found are recorded without documentation). Research of digitally accessible texts shows that the phrases were used and modified throughout antiquity, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, by the famous writers as well as in obscure documents. Such memorable collocations signalize general linguistic competence of Nicholas, bishop of Modru\u0161; they were a feature of general use of Latin during the premodern period in Europe.","tags":["myown","neo-latin","hrvatskiLatinisti","nikolamodru\u0161ki","stilistika"],"url":"https:\/\/osf.io\/bg37w","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22e27da17daa6981f68fcc6331bfdb925\/filologanoga","type":"Publication","search term":"Hiphop"},{"title":"From dated to dynamic: a campus newsletter unfolds as a web service.","authors":["Kevin W.

It reveals a high sense of state and a full acceptance of the role of bishop also in the imposition of civil justice (\u201choly public office\u201d). The writings of the same period by other bishops (the Oriental-Greek bishops as much as those of the West, from Gregory of Nazianzus to Maximus of Turin) confirm this willingness to be part of an imperial power, remote but at the same time operative through local authorities which the bishop was able and indeed obliged to monitor closely. It is shown how the absence of any conflict between the conscience of the priest and that of the imperial official finds its most explicit formulations in Ambrose of Milan, whose relationships with the highest ranks of political power (often present in the city) were, however, much closer and more complex. In response to recent studies (N. McLynn) an attempt has been made through a precise analysis of sources and specific situations to show how it was this self-same ex-clarissimus Ambrose who elaborated a new episcopal style able to safeguard and increase the prestige of his own authority also of a secular nature thanks to a charismatic \u201cshield\u201d patiently constructed and carefully dispensed in its formulations and the scriptural models selected: in particular, the exemplum of the prophet Elisha, the king's counsellor and the worker of countless miracles to guarantee his own authority (Elisha, once the favourite of Athanasius of Alexandria whom Ambrose must have met in Rome in his youth and whose follower he became both in theology and sometimes in literature). Thus on the foundation of this new \u201crhetoric\u201d of episcopal power, on an unremitting pastoral and exegetic activity and on the attentive choice of collaborators of an elevated cultural level within his own sphere of influence Ambrose set in motion an episcopal model of high profile. In Northern Italy as in Gaul this model can be discerned sustaining the \u201cnoble bishops\u201d of the 5th and 6th century, who become more and more rigidly distinct from the mass of the faithful and revered for their political as much as for their spiritual virtues. This was a radical mutation within the ecclesiastical ranks and is quite unparalleled in the dioceses of peninsular Italy of that time.

In this paper, we study the mirror sector dynamics of a two-dimensional chiral gauge theory in the limitof strong Yukawa and vanishing gauge couplings, in which case it reduces to an XY model coupled to Ginsparg-Wilson fermions. For the mirror fermions to acquire cutoff-scale mass it is believed to be important that the XY model remain in its \"high temperature\" phase, where there is no algebraic ordering--a conjecture supported by the results of our work. We use analytic and Monte-Carlo methods with dynamical fermions to study the scalar and fermion susceptibilities, and the mirror fermion spectrum. Our results provide convincing evidence that the strong dynamics does not \"break\" the chiral symmetry (more precisely, that the mirror fermions do not induce algebraic ordering in two-dimensions), and that the mirror fermions decouple from the infrared physics.","tags":["ChiralSymmetry","GinspargWilson","Lattice","HiggsYukawa"],"url":"http:\/\/www.slac.stanford.edu\/spires\/find\/hep\/www?eprint=hep-lat\/0701004","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2fc5c73126bfd99f70ebc7a1052e93e65\/gber","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Less naive about supersymmetric lattice quantum\r\n                  mechanics","authors":["Joel Giedt","Roman Koniuk","Erich Poppitz","Tzahi Yavin"],"year":"2004","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Abstract: We explain why naive discretization results that have appeared in hep-lat\/0006013 do not appear to yield the desired continuum limit.

This diagram gives a finite correction to the boson 2-point function that must be subtracted off in order to obtain the perturbation series of the continuum theory, in the limit where the lattice spacing $a$ vanishes. Using a transfer matrix approach, we provide a nonperturbative proof that this counterterm suffices to yield the desired continuum limit. This analysis also allows us to improve the action to O(a). We demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulation that the spectrum of the continuum theory is well-approximated at finite but small $a$, for both weak and strong coupling. We contrast the above situation for the naive lattice action to what occurs for the supersymmetric lattice action, which preserves a discrete version of half the supersymmetry.

They interpolate between the microphysical laws and the complex macroscopic phenomena. Our approach yields a simple unified description for O(N)-symmetric scalar models in two, three or four dimensions, covering in particular the critical phenomena for the second-order phase transitions, including the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and the critical behavior of polymer chains. We compute the aspects of the critical equation of state which are universal for a large variety of physical systems and establish a direct connection between microphysical and critical quantities for a liquid-gas transition. Universal features of first-order phase transitions are studied in the context of scalar matrix models.

We look, in detail, at one example - supersymmetric quantum mechanics which possesses two such BRST symmetries. In this case, we show that the lattice theory can be obtained by blocking out of the continuum in a carefully chosen background metric. Such a procedure will not change the Ward identities corresponding to the BRST symmetries since they correspond to topological observables. Thus, at the quantum level, the continuum BRST symmetry is preserved in the lattice theory.

This condition is expected to be satisfied generally if the theory is finite perturbatively, provided that discretization does not induce further symmetry breaking.

We then put this theory on the lattice, which preserves supersymmetry except for a breaking in interaction terms by the failure of the Leibniz rule. By this way, we define a lattice Wess-Zumino model which maintains the basic properties such as $U(1)U(1)_R$ symmetry and holomorphicity. We show that this model reproduces continuum theory in the limit $a0$ up to any finite order in perturbation theory; in this sense all the supersymmetry breaking terms induced by the failure of the Leibniz rule are irrelevant.

In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multi-soliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large $N$ expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order $p$.","tags":["Supersymmetry","HamiltonFormalism","PathIntegral","StrongCoupling","WKB","IsospectralHamilton","SQM"],"url":"http:\/\/www.slac.stanford.edu\/spires\/find\/hep\/www?eprint=hep-th\/9405029","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2799db6625a50b734349f8713159ee0a2\/gber","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Fixed point actions for lattice fermions","authors":["Wolfgang Bietenholz","U.

OBJECTIVES: Determination of 1. the frequency of appearance of lower limbs' pain among patients with subluxation and dislocation of the hip joint in the course of spastic form of cerebral palsy; 2. the influence of the surgical treatment on pain development. MATERIALS: We analysed 82 patients (126 spastic hips) treated between 1970 to 1995 with spastic form of cerebral palsy. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to the degree of hip instability and the performed method of treatment. Group 1-41 patients (77 spastic hips) without neurogenic instability of hip (mean value of migration percentage (MP) - 25\\%), group II - 14 patients (19 hips) with untreated dislocation of hip (MP - 100\\%), group III- 25 patients (30 hips) with dislocation and subluxation of hips treated by open reduction combined with Dega's pelvic osteotomy and intertrochanteric varus osteotomy of femur. METHODS: Each patient underwent clinical and radiological evaluation of hips. We assessed the value of migration percentage according to Reimers. We adopted the scale of intensity of pain according to Barie: 1) no pain, 2) sporadic pains, 3) frequent pains retreating after administration of routine analgesic drugs, 4) frequent pains persisting after administration of typical analgesics. The evaluation of pains also comprised their localisation within the hip joint and the knee joint of the same limb (projected pains). RESULTS: Group I in 11.7\\% of hips occurred mild pain, in 20.8\\% light pain and in 67.5\\% pain didn't occur, there was no severe pain. In group II in 73.7\\% appeared severe and mild pain, in 10.5\\% light pain and in 15.8\\% pain didn't appear. In group III severe and mild pain occurred in 37\\%, light in 33\\% and no pain in 30\\%. In all groups appearance and severity of pain depends of the degree of hip dislocation (p < 0.01 to 0.001). Appearance and aggravation of hips' pain depends on the degree of decentration of the femur's head from the acetabulum, estimated by the migration percentage (MP).

Namely we require that the relevant couplings present in the physical effective action, the coefficients of the field monomials with dimension not larger than four, are fixed to satisfy the Slavnov-Taylor identities. The full action obtained from the RG equation should then satisfy the same identities. This procedure is similar to the one we used in QED. In this way we avoid the cospicuous fine tuning problem which arises if one gives instead the couplings of the bare Lagrangian. To show the practical character of this formulation we deduce the perturbative expansion for the vertex functions in terms of the physical coupling $g$ at the subtraction point $\\mu$ and perform one loop calculations.

The chiral (non-abelian) gauge anomaly is derived by evaluating the anomalous triangle diagram with three non-abelian gauge fields coupled to a chiral fermion. We discuss in detail the relation between anomaly, current non-conservation and non-invariance of the effective action, with special emphasis on the derivation of the anomalous Slavnov-Taylor\/Ward identities. We show why anomalies always are finite and local. A general characterization is given of gauge groups and fermion representations which may lead to anomalies in four dimensions, and the issue of anomaly cancellation is discussed, in particular the classical example of the standard model.\r\nThen, we move to more formal developments and arbitrary even dimensions. After introducing a few basic notions of differential geometry, in particular characteristic classes, we derive the descent equations. We prove the Wess-Zumino consistency condition and show that relevant anomalies correspond to BRST cohomologies at ghost number one. We discuss why and how anomalies are related to characteristic classes in two more dimensions and outline their computation in terms of the index of an appropriate Dirac operator.

OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a retrospective study of children with bilateral cerebral palsy who had various postural management and its effect on hip deformity. The most widely accepted theoretical model of hip subluxation\/dislocation is that an imbalance in muscle length and strength around the hip leads to acetabular dysplasia and consequent hip subluxation. Maintenance of muscle length and strength and loadbearing is therefore a logical prevention. Research on normal infants' postures has provided biomechanical data to form the theoretical basis of 24 h postural management equipment. METHODS: The notes and X-rays of 59 children with bilateral cerebral palsy from East and West Sussex and Oxfordshire were examined and measured to determine whether a relationship existed between postural management and the level of hip subluxation\/dislocation. X-rays were measured using Reimers' hip migration percentage. Postural management support was divided into three groups for analysis. Category 1: use of a 24-h postural management approach using Chailey Adjustable Postural Support (CAPS) systems in lying, sitting and standing; category 2: two items of CAPS (either lying\/sitting or sitting\/standing supports); category 3: use of the CAPS seat only and\/or any other postural supports. Hip status was recorded for analysis as both hips safe (under 33\\% migrated), or one\/both hips subluxed. RESULTS: Children using 'All CAPS' before hip subluxation maintained significantly more hip integrity than other groups (chi2 P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Postural management interventions have an important role in the prevention of hip dysplasia.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Male;","Congenital;","Hip","Retrospective","Great","Studies","Palsy;","Female;","Dislocation,","Posture;","Britain;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20f1f3d0ac48082487e756aaa4ecb0258\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"The windblown hip syndrome in total body cerebral palsy.","authors":["M.

We think that the presence of cerebral palsy, even in the patient with severe involvement, is not a contraindication for either a hip arthrodesis or a total hip replacement for a painful deformed or degenerated hip. These patients should be treated for the pain in the hip, and the presence of the underlying neuromuscular disorder should not deter the appropriate treatment. For unilateral hip disease in patients who are unable to walk and in young, active patients, we recommend hip fusion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","tags":["Humans;","Postoperative","Adult;","Instability;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Prosthesis;","Methods;","Dislocation;","Arthrodesis;","Joint","Hip","Pain;","Palsy;","Care;","Female;","Complications;","Recurrence"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2dcfb09a70e13b5a219cb45d4c75423b6\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"The sign problem is the solution","authors":["J.

It is unclear whether surgical treatment is indicated for progressive hip subluxation in immature patients with severe involvement. In the present study, we evaluated seventy-seven adults who were profoundly affected with cerebral palsy to determine if either spastic hip displacement (subluxation or dislocation) or osteoarthritis was associated with hip pain and\/or diminished function. METHODS: Data regarding the medical history, level of function, pain, and use of analgesics were obtained from a review of medical records and from caregiver interviews. The range of motion of the hip, the degree of spasticity, the presence of pressure ulcers, and changes in vital signs as well as in the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability behavioral pain score were documented. Radiographs of the pelvis and spine were blindly evaluated for evidence of osteoarthritis and subluxation or dislocation. Statistical analysis was performed in order to identify associations between the medical history, the physical examination findings, and the radiographic measurements. RESULTS: The study group included seventy-seven adult subjects (thirty-eight men and thirty-nine women) with a mean age of forty years. Twenty-three (15\\%) of the 154 hips in these subjects were dislocated, eighteen (12\\%) were subluxated, and thirty-five (23\\%) had radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis. Twenty-eight (18\\%) of the 154 hips were definitely painful, and sixty-nine (45\\%) were definitely not painful. Increased hip pain and problems with perineal care were noted in patients with decreased hip abduction (<30 degrees ) (p = 0.01), windswept hip deformities (p = 0.02), and flexion contractures of >30 degrees (p = 0.07). Increased spasticity was associated with higher rates of osteoarthritis, dislocation, pain, and pressure ulcers. Spastic hip subluxation or dislocation was significantly associated with osteoarthritis (p = 0.0001), but not with hip pain. There was no association between radiographic evidence of osteoarthritis and hip pain. CONCLUSIONS: Neither hip displacement (i.e., subluxation or dislocation) nor osteoarthritis was found to be associated with hip pain or diminished function. Because the prevalence of hip pain is low and is not associated with hip displacement or osteoarthritis, we suggest that surgical treatment of the hip in severely affected patients be based on the presence of pain or contractures and not on radiographic signs of hip displacement or osteoarthritis.

Since walking has to be considered the strongest stimulus for the dislocation-preventing hip abductors, hip extensors, outward rotators and knee extensors, the erect gait should be encouraged with statomotorically favored children early as possible.

On the radiographs of 297 hips with developmental dysplasia, lateral flattening of the femoral head was seen in 18 hips (6\\%), but notching was present in only 1. Of 7 dysplasias due to cerebral palsy, 6 showed lateral notching. The gluteus minimus was felt to be responsible for the lateral femoral head changes as the muscle counteracts lateral migration of the femoral head. Intraoperative dissection of 3 hips supported this view. 1 hip with developmental dysplasia and lateral notching was subjected to a periacetabular osteotomy. At surgery, the tendon of the gluteus minimus was found to fit tightly into the notch. Of 2 hips with spastic dysplasia, 1 presented with and the other without lateral notching. In the hip with lateral notching, the gluteus minimus had a normal appearance and it lay in the defect of the femoral head. In the hip without notching, the gluteus minimus was atrophied with signs of fatty degeneration.

The pattern of spasticity that results in muscle imbalance around the hip joint and changes in proximal femur architecture causes hip subluxation or dislocation, which may be either, posterior, anterior, or midsuperior. 3DCT studies are required to analyze accurately and understand acetabular deficiency in childhood NMD. These image data also allow more accurate planning for surgery in neuromuscular hip dysplasia.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Acetabulum;","Adult;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocation;","Preschool;","Hip","Computed","Child,","Neuromuscular","Infant;","Palsy;","Female;","Diseases;","X-Ray","Models,","Tomography,","Anatomic;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2be1241c67f62c1ddd891d3b3ec912741\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"The associated effects of untreated unilateral hip dislocation in cerebral palsy scoliosis.","authors":["Hakan Senaran","Suken A Shah","Joseph J Glutting","Kirk W Dabney","Freeman Miller"],"year":"2006","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"INTRODUCTION: The presence of a unilateral hip dislocation in children with cerebral palsy (CP) may cause problems with sitting imbalance, pressure ulcers, and hip pain. There is a dynamic interplay between hip dislocation, pelvic obliquity (PO), and scoliosis. The effect of an untreated unilateral hip dislocation on the rate of curve progression of CP scoliosis has not been defined in the literature. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of unilateral hip dislocation on PO and the rate of curve progression in children with spastic quadriplegic CP. METHODS: Patients with spastic quadriplegic CP who had spine radiographs at the time of initial presentation with scoliosis and at the latest follow-up were evaluated. Twenty-three children with spastic CP who had an untreated unilateral hip dislocation and scoliosis constituted the study group. The control group consisted of 83 quadriplegic CP patients with scoliosis and well-located hips. The rate of curve progression, incidence of PO, and the rate of PO progression at follow-up were compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: The mean ages of patients with a unilateral dislocation and with well-located hips at initial radiograph were 10.4 and 10.5 years, respectively. The mean follow-up was 3.5 years. The mean rate of scoliosis curve progression in patients with a unilateral hip dislocation was 12.9 degrees per year. In the control group, the mean progression rate was 12.2 degrees per year. The incidence of PO at follow-up was 74\\% in scoliotic patients with a dislocation and 63\\% in scoliotic patients with normal hips. Using repeated-measures analysis of variance, unilateral hip dislocation was found to have no significant effect on scoliosis progression; however, progression of PO was significantly increased in the hip dislocation group (P < 0.05). Pelvic obliquity was corrected after posterior spinal fusion to the sacrum with pelvic fixation, without reducing the hip(s) at the same surgery. CONCLUSION: Unilateral hip dislocation causes a significant increase of PO but does not affect the rate of scoliosis curve progression.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Disease","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Progression;","Male;","Dislocation;","Illness","Index","Severity","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Retrospective","Child,","Palsy;","Female;","of","Scoliosis;","Studies;","Osteotomy;"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1097\/01.bpo.0000242426.60995.29","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29cb84e5c471bfcbcd6b3b59cedd595d0\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Taming the Leibniz Rule on the Lattice","authors":["Mitsuhiro Kato","Makoto Sakamoto","Hiroto So"],"year":"2008","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Abstract: We study a product rule and a difference operator equipped with Leibniz rule in a general framework of lattice field theory.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty hip joints in 26 children with cerebral palsy were operated applying the same complex reconstruction method of the hip joint. Fifteen of these children with 17 operated hip joints fulfilled a minimum follow up period of 3 years were evaluated continuously in this study. The parents and physiotherapists answered a questionnaire, all patients were examined clinically and pelvic anteroposterior and lateral radiographs were obtained. RESULTS: The mean age at surgery was 6 years, the minimum follow up 3 years (3-10 years). All hip joints were preoperatively decentered, 6 subluxated, 11 complete dislocated. At follow-up 15 of 17 were persistently reduced. The postoperative results were graded by the parents as excellent and good in eleven, satisfying in four and in two patients as poor. The radiographic evaluation showed an significant improvement of the CE-, AC- and neck shaft angle. CONCLUSION: Reconstruction of decentered hips will lead to stable reduction and painless hips at least in mid term follow-up. Symmetrically centered hip joints are mandatory for a pelvic and spinal symmetry and may contribute for an optimal of psychomotoric development.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Postoperative","Joint;","Cerebral","Male;","Motion,","Congenital;","Range","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Child,","Palsy;","Female;","Outcome","of","Dislocation,","Treatment","Complications;","Articular;","Studies;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/218decd4310f30b81f821089c090f22e0\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Varus derotation osteotomy for the treatment of hip subluxation and dislocation in cerebral palsy: statistical analysis in 73 hips.","authors":["K.

This retrospective analysis evaluates the relationship between the degree of hip flexion contracture found on static testing and the degree found during gait and also assesses the strength of the association between hip flexion contractures and compensatory mechanisms such as anterior pelvic tilting, increased knee flexion, and decreased contralateral step length. Clinical and quantitative gait laboratory data were obtained from 41 consecutive patients with mostly neurologically based impairments who presented with bilateral hip flexion contractures on Thomas testing (82 limbs). Correlation studies demonstrated a relatively weak association between the degree of peak hip extension during gait and hip flexion contracture by Thomas testing (r = 0.41, P < 0.0001). Limited hip extension was most closely associated with anterior pelvic tilting (r = 0.60, P < 0.0001), whereas Thomas test measurements yielded a correlation with anterior pelvic tilt of only r = 0.36 (P < 0.001) and were insignificant predictor variables of anterior pelvic tilting in regression analysis. Thus, peak hip extension and anterior pelvic tilting assessed during gait were poorly associated with the static Thomas test measurements, and anterior pelvic tilt was most strongly correlated with reduced hip extension during gait compared with the other compensatory mechanisms.","tags":["Humans;","Cerebrovascula;","Aged,","Gait;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Motion,","Regression","Range","Hip","Middle","Retrospective","Aged;","r","Palsy;","over;","Female;","e;","Anthropometry;","Predictive","Analysis;","80","Value","Studies;","Child;","Brain","Adult;","Tests;","Disorders","Male;","Contractur;","of","and","Injuries;","Articular;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2619bebf53c7aaab82c90adf0994b92ce\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"The hip in cerebral palsy.","authors":["E.

The incidence of knee and hip arthroplasty during 2002\u20132011 was determined by linking the cohort records to the Australian Orthopaedic Association National Joint Replacement Registry.Results: Over 9.1 \u00b1 2.3 years (mean \u00b1 sd)) of follow-up, 317 participants had knee and 202 had hip arthroplasty for osteoarthritis.

Targeting weight loss has the potential to reduce the risk of knee arthroplasty and improve patient outcomes, even in those with poor physical performance.","tags":["imported"],"url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1080\/03009742.2018.1458148","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/27484e000f265220f34efaafde1183244\/djtlmd","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Surgical treatment of secondary hip dislocation in cerebral palsy","authors":["C.

The selection and application of adequate surgical techniques require an outstanding knowledge of pathophysiology in order to achieve a good outcome with minimal operative expenditure.The hips of cerebral palsied children show no pathological findings at birth. The dislocation of the hip is a secondary process, due to the influence of permanently deteriorating muscle dysbalances that first cause a decentration and finally result in a complete dislocation.Physiotherapeutic treatment supports the development of gait, muscle balance and weight bearing in the early childhood, however, severe hip dislocation can not be prevented with physiotherapy alone.Surgical treatment aims to prevent hip dislocation in order to maintain the ability to walk and to sit, and to avoid secondary skin ulcers. Soft tissue release is performed to neutralize muscle dysbalances. Progressive dislocation requires extended surgical treatment. The combination of soft tissue release, varisation osteotomy and acetabular osteotomy enable an adequate repositioning of the hip and have proved to preserve hips from reluxation. Palliative operations including soft tissue release in combination with angulation osteotomy, and proximal femoral head resection are restricted to failed reconstruction operations or severe luxations, and are performed to attempt pain reduction or the facilitation of perineal care.Surgical planning distinguishes patients able to walk from those who are unable to walk or to sit without support. The manifestation of cerebral palsy and the aim of adequate pain reduction and the maintenance of statomotoric abilities also have a great impact on surgical planning.The treatment of secondary hip dislocation in cerebral palsy is facilitated by the use of a graduated treatment concept with early preventive soft tissue release, extended reconstruction and optional palliative care.","tags":["Therapy","Child;","Humans;","Factors;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocation;","Hip;","Time","Modalities;","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Child,","Physical","Walking","Palsy;","Care;","Female;","Palliative","Osteoarthritis,","Studies;","Osteotomy;"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00132-004-0686-4","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/29fca31b6abe8dfc0d5c024b415a616e7\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Surgical prevention of paralytic dislocation of the hip in cerebral palsy.","authors":["G.

Knowledge regarding its overall incidence and associated risk factors can facilitate treatment of these children. METHODS: An inception cohort was generated from the Victorian Cerebral Palsy Register for the birth years 1990 through 1992, inclusive, and multiple data sources pertaining to the cohort were reviewed during 2004. Gross motor function was assessed for each child and was graded according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS), which is a valid, reliable, five-level ordinal grading system. Hip displacement, defined as a migration percentage of >30\\%, was measured on an anteroposterior radiograph of the pelvis with use of a reliable technique. RESULTS: A full data set was obtained for 323 (86\\%) of 374 children in the Register for the birth years 1990 through 1992. The mean duration of follow-up was eleven years and eight months. The incidence of hip displacement for the entire birth cohort was 35\\%, and it showed a linear relationship with the level of gross motor function. The incidence of hip displacement was 0\\% for children with GMFCS level I and 90\\% for those with GMFCS level V. Compared with children with GMFCS level II, those with levels III, IV, and V had significantly higher relative risks of hip displacement (2.7, 4.6, and 5.9, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Hip displacement is common in children with cerebral palsy, with an overall incidence of 35\\% found in this study. The risk of hip displacement is directly related to gross motor function as graded with the Gross Motor Function Classification System. This information may be important when assessing the risk of hip displacement for an individual child who has cerebral palsy, for counseling parents, and in the design of screening programs and resource allocation.","tags":["Walking;","Movement","Hemiplegia;","Cerebral","Dislocation;","Devices;","mans","Hu;","Follow-Up","Hip","Quadriplegia;","Self-Help","Palsy;","Running;","Cohort","Studies;","Disorders;","Child;","Factors;","Hypotonia;","Dystonia;","Risk","Spasticity;","Musculoskeletal","Locomotion;","Equilibrium;","Wheelchairs;","Muscle"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2106\/JBJS.E.00071","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/21ab31a72d0cca36dc158a3bf30c7a594\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Inflationary perturbations from deformed CFT","authors":["Jan Pieter van der Schaar"],"year":"2004","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["string","holography","inflation","theory"],"url":"http:\/\/www.slac.stanford.edu\/spires\/find\/hep\/www?eprint=hep-th\/0307271","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/207cb0cc18e2329bb073b273a4f7de60d\/jpschaar","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Supersymmetry on a spatial lattice","authors":["David B.

Spastic hip disease occurs when the muscles about the hip exert forces that are too high or in the wrong direction or both. To determine the role of the hip forces in the progression of spastic hip disease and the effect of both muscle-lengthening and bony reconstructive surgeries, a computerized mathematical model of a spastic hip joint was created. The magnitude and direction of the forces of spastic hips undergoing surgery were analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively to determine which procedure is best suited for the treatment of spastic hip disease. The muscle-lengthening procedures included (a) the adductor longus, (b) the psoas, iliacus, gracilis, adductor brevis, and adductor longus, and (3) the psoas, iliacus, gracilis, adductor brevis, adductor longus, semimembranosus, and semitendinosus.

Results show that a child with spastic hip disease has a hip-force magnitude 3 times that of the a child with a normal hip in the normal physiologic position. Based on this mathematical model the best to normalize the magnitude of the hip-joint reaction force, the muscles to be lengthened should include the psoas, iliacus, gracilis, adductor brevis, and the adductor longus. To normalize the direction of the hip force, the extremity should be positioned in the normal physiologic position. The impact of decreasing the femoral anteversion or femoral neck-shaft angle or both had little additional effect on the direction or magnitude of hip forces.","tags":["Humans;","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Reference","Motion,","Range","Hip","Sensitivity","Palsy;","Biological;","Female;","Dislocation,","Models,","Simulation;","Dissection;","Values;","Child;","Infant,","Joint;","Male;","Newborn;","Congenital;","Specificity","of","and","Computer","Articular;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2c6425e3c87d4d5f4ab83925039a4a8a4\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Prevention of development of hip joint instability in patients with the spastic form of juvenile cerebral palsy","authors":["R.

MATERIAL: The study included 45 children with contractures of the hip adductors and flexors and hip subluxations due to spastic cerebral palsy. Thirty three of them were boys and 12 were girls. Their ages ranged from 2 to 13 years. Preoperative and postoperative roentgenograms of 82 hip joints were investigated. METHODS: Open tenotomies of m. adductor longus and brevis, m. gracilis, m. rectus femoris and m. psoas major. The immobilisation by POP casts lasted for 6 weeks. Abduction and extension bracing followed the plaster removal in all children. The hip joints were radiographed in neutral rotation both before and at least 6 months after the operation. Reimers migration percentage (MP) and Wiberg angle (CE angle) known as the parameters of hip instability were assessed. The obtained data were statistically analysed. RESULTS: The preoperative MP was below 25\\% in 25 hips, between 25 and 39\\% in 33 hips, between 40 and 59\\% in 14, and over 59\\% in 10 hips. The analysis of postoperative roentgenograms showed the following MP distribution: 56 less than 25\\%, 23 between 25 and 39\\%, and 3 greater than 40\\%. No postoperative MP was higher than 49\\%. 54\\% formerly subluxated hips achieved normal MP. The difference between preoperative and postoperative MP was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Before the tenotomies 24 hips were normal with CE angle over 20 degrees. It was between 20 degrees and 11 degrees in 28 cases and between 10 degrees and 1 degree in 17 cases. The preoperative CE angle was negative in 13 cases. Postoperatively CE angle was higher than 20 degrees in 53 hips. It was between 20 degrees and 11 degrees in 22 cases and between 10 degrees and 1 degree in 7 cases. The minimum CE angle after soft-tissue release was 4 degrees. The difference between preoperative and postoperative CE angles was statistically significant (P < 0.001). MP improved in 93\\% and CE angles in 96\\% of cases. DISCUSSION: Classical tenotomies of the spastic hip adductors used to be recommended in prevention of the hip subluxation in cerebral palsy patients. MP improved in 70\\% of cases in the Reimers' study (1980) based on selective adductors tenotomies. If the soft tissue release was unsuccessful bony operation was indicated. Kalen and Black claimed in 1985 that if psoas tenotomy was performed in addition to adductors tenotomies MP improvement was attained in 80-100\\% of cases. CONCLUSION: Adductors and flexors tenotomies can correct the spastic hip joint instability fully and permanently if the operation is performed prior to bony changes of the hip. The operation being followed by appropriate immobilisation and physiotherapy increases the percentage of good results.","tags":["Contracture;","Child;","Humans;","Joint;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocation;","Spasticity;","Preschool;","Hip","Care","Child,","Muscle,","Skeletal;","Palsy;","tive","Female;","Prospective","Postopera;","Muscle","Studies;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26566d021be974cd9cc9598013c3345d6\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Hip and knee positions during the curling delivery","authors":["Ellanora Kraemer"],"year":"2010","editors":["Glenn Wright","Mark Gibson"],"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"The primary purpose of this study was to determine the relationships between trunk, thigh, hip and knee measurements from the forward slide phase of the curling delivery.

This study was performed to determine the incidence of hip subluxation in children with CP who underwent SDR at a single institution. METHODS: The study group comprised 82 patients (164 hip joints) with a mean follow up of 3.9 years. Forty-four patients had spastic diplegia (53.6\\%), 35 had spastic quadriplegia (42.7\\%), two had spastic triplegia (2.4\\%), and one had spastic hemiplegia (1.2\\%). The mean patient age at SDR was 5.2 +\/- 2.4 years. Preoperative and postoperative hip radiographs were reviewed and the femoral head center edge (CE) angles were recorded. The mean pre- and postoperative right CE angles were 14.1 and 17.2 degrees, respectively, and those of the left were 13.6 and 15.1 degrees, respectively. Considering a change in CE angle greater than 5 degrees as clinically significant, 72 hips (43.5\\%) remained unchanged, 63 (38.4\\%) improved, and 29 (17.7\\%) worsened. Of a number of preoperative variables, including age at time of surgery, Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) level, ambulatory status, extent of hip subluxation, preoperative scoliosis, and asymmetry of hip subluxation, only GMFCS level was associated with worsening of hip subluxation. CONCLUSIONS: Selective dorsal rhizotomy is more likely to have a positive effect or no effect on hip joint subluxation rather than to have a negative effect. More severe involvement, as measured using the GMFCS, may predispose to worsening of hip subluxation after SDR.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Joint;","Adolescent;","Tests;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocations;","Preschool;","Hip","Retrospective","Child,","Palsy;","Female;","Incidence;","Predictive","of","Value","Rhizotomy","Studies;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2086779a4cca1c9274cc9118eb67d7b93\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Treatment of acquired hip subluxation in cerebral palsy.","authors":["J.

The concept of the cover song was invented by rock and enabled by sound recording technology that allowed a particular performance, rather than a particular song, to be the reference for iteration.

The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of hip flexion on the rotational moment arms of the hip muscles. We hypothesized that flexion of the hip would increase internal rotation moment arms and decrease external rotation moment arms of the primary hip rotators. To test this hypothesis we measured rotational moment arms of the gluteus maximus (six compartments), gluteus medius (four compartments), gluteus minimus (three compartments) iliopsoas, piriformis, quadratus femoris, obturator internus, and obturator externus. Moment arms were measured at hip flexion angles of 0, 20, 45, 60, and 90 degrees in four cadavers. A three-dimensional computer model of the hip muscles was developed and compared to the experimental measurements. The experimental results and the computer model showed that the internal rotation moment arms of some muscles increase with flexion; the external rotation moment arms of other muscles decrease, and some muscles switch from external rotation to internal rotation as the hip is flexed. This trend toward internal rotation with hip flexion was apparent in 15 of the 18 muscle compartments we examined, suggesting that excessive hip flexion may exacerbate internal rotation of the hip. The gluteus maximus was found to have a large capacity for external rotation. Enhancing the activation of the gluteus maximus, a muscle that is frequently underactive in persons with cerebral palsy, may help correct excessive flexion and internal rotation of the hip.","tags":["Humans;","Gait;","Thigh","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Rotation;","Motion,","Range","Muscles;","Cadaver;","Hip","Palsy;","Biological;","Buttocks;","Femur;","Models,","Simulation;","Psoas","Joint;","Muscle,","Skeletal;","of","Computer","Contraction;","Muscle","Articular;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2778aa2bacb0dd5e4fd652daf7ef70854\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Adductor and psoas release for subluxation of the hip in children with spastic cerebral palsy.","authors":["M.

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of evolution of two paralogous genes, hap and iga, which encode the adhesion and penetration Hap protein and the IgA1 protease respectively. Partial sequencing of hap and iga genes in a comprehensive collection of strains belonging to the H. influenzae\/H. aegyptius complex revealed considerable genetic polymorphism and pronounced mosaic-like patterns in both genes, but no evidence of intrastrain recombination between the two genes. A conserved hap pseudogene was present in all strains of H. aegyptius and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius, each of which constituted distinct subpopulations as revealed by phylogenetic analysis. There was no evidence for a second, functional copy of the hap gene in these strains. The perturbed expression of the Hap serine protease appears to be associated with the formation of elongated bacterial cells growing in chains and a distinct colonization pattern on conjunctival cells, previously termed microcolony formation. The fact that individual hap pseudogenes differed from the ancestral sequence by zero to two positions within a 1.5 kb stretch suggests that the silencing event happened approximately 2000-11,000 years ago. Divergence of H. aegyptius and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius occurred subsequent to this genetic event.

Soft-tissue releases have proved to be beneficial in the prevention of spastic hip dislocation. A protocol for treatment based on patient age, hip abduction, and hip migration percentage was established in 1988. The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome in sixty-five children treated according to this protocol and followed for a minimum of eight years. METHODS: The medical records and radiographs of sixty-five children, from an original series of seventy-four patients, who met the inclusion criteria were available for review. Forty-seven children had spastic quadriplegia and were unable to walk; eighteen children had spastic diplegia and were able to walk independently or with assistive devices. The mean age at the time of the surgery was 4.4 years. Open adductor tenotomy and psoas muscle recession or iliopsoas tenotomy were performed on 129 hips, which were followed for a mean of 10.8 years. The mean age at the time of follow-up was fifteen years. Hips were grouped according to the hip migration percentage preoperatively, at one year postoperatively, and at the time of final follow-up. The final outcome for the patient was defined according to the worse hip. An analysis was performed to identify potential factors influencing outcome. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients (49\\%) had a good result, eleven (17\\%) had a fair result, three (4\\%) had a poor result, and nineteen (30\\%) had a failure. The mean hip migration percentage was 34\\% preoperatively and 18\\% at the time of final follow-up. Nineteen patients required subsequent osseous reconstructive procedures, and eleven required repeat soft-tissue releases. The migration percentage at one year postoperatively was the most predictive of the final outcome (p = 0.001). Patients who had been able to walk preoperatively had a better long-term outcome (p = 0.01). Neither the preoperative hip migration percentage nor the age at surgery significantly affected the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: Soft-tissue release was effective for long-term prevention of hip dislocation in 67\\% (forty-three) of sixty-five children with spastic hip subluxation. Two preoperative factors that were related to a favorable outcome were a spastic diplegic pattern of involvement and the ability to walk. The hip migration percentage at one year postoperatively was a good predictor of final outcome.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Cerebral","Male;","Orthopedic","Dislocation;","Spasticity;","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Retrospective","Child,","Infant;","Palsy;","Female;","Outcome","Procedures;","Muscle","Treatment","Studies;"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.2106\/JBJS.C.01099","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23458540a148af5947809144c20568e91\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Bubbling AdS space and 1\/2 BPS geometries","authors":["Hai Lin","Oleg Lunin","Juan Martin Maldacena"],"year":"2004","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["imported"],"url":"http:\/\/www.slac.stanford.edu\/spires\/find\/hep\/www?eprint=hep-th\/0409174","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/26c6cca60377a0b33afcd60b90d066814\/corneliu","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Hip changes in infantile cerebral palsy","authors":["H.

In the final analysis, hip dislocation associated with cerebral motor disturbances is attributable to a more or less constant muscle imbalance. The prognosis for hip development is poor if there is an early tendency toward flexion and adduction postures and the course of general motor development is unfavorable. The classification proposed by T?nnis and Brunken (1968) is used for radiological assessment. The primary goal of therapy is to prevent further decentration of the hip joint.

Femoral head resection has been proven be effective in severely dislocated hip joints in completely immobilized patients, whereas no satisfactory outcome is achieved in those patients with sufficient walking ability and moderate expression of spasticity. RESULTS: The following study investigates the results of total hip replacement (THR) in patients with tetraspastic cerebral palsy. Between 1992 and 2004, 19 total hip arthroplasties were performed in 175 patients with an average follow-up of 4,6 years. In all patients the walking ability improved significantly; 84\\% of the patients were pain free. Aseptic loosening of the femoral component was registered in one patient. A periprosthetic fracture in another patient required the implantation of a modular non-cemented femoral component. CONCLUSION: In this study total hip arthroplasty represents an important expansion of operative treatment options in secondary osteoarthritis of cerebral palsy in selected and cooperative patients. Taking the contradictions into consideration (severe athetosis, absence of adequate weight bearing, severe pelvic obliquity), THR promises to be an effective alternative to femoral head resection with significant pain reduction and improvement of walking abilities.","tags":["Humans;","Arthralgia;","Adult;","Gait","Cerebral","Male;","Hip;","Middle","Aged;","Arthroplasty,","Palsy;","Female;","Outcome","Neurologic;","Osteoarthritis,","Treatment","Replacement,","Disorders,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/s00132-006-0988-9","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/28d69f2ebaac95cbc8a43b2e21f73005e\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Host Identity Protocol (HIP) Registration Extension","authors":["T.

RESULTS: Data presented in the literature vary greatly. Populations are representative of the referral network of the teams reporting the study rather than the cerebral palsy population in general. Signs reported were pain, difficult nursing procedures, difficult sitting position, pressure sores and fractures, but only one sign can be taken fully into account: 50 p. cent of the dislocated hip joints were painful. DISCUSSION: No one study gives a precise assessment of the prevalence of hip excentration and displacement and its consequences in patients with cerebral palsy. In a population of quadriplegic patients who do not walk, the question is whether complementary tenotomy should be performed, knowking the difficult operative and postoperative situation of such procedures. In this population, walking is an exceptional goal of bone surgery, pain relief and patient comfort are more common goals. Data in this literature (50 p. 100 of the dislocated hips are painful) suggest a prudent approach. However, there is no known marker which can be used to distinguish hips which will become painful from those which will remain pain free. In addition, irreversible cartilage degeneration can cause pain contraindicating reconstructive surgery.","tags":["Walking","Prevalence;","Humans;","Pain;","Quadriplegia;","Factors;","Joint;","Palsy;","Cerebral","Dislocation;","Risk","Hip"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2a4e1c7d137e01aad6ae1c595a0b5629a\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Open adductor tenotomy in the prevention of hip subluxation in cerebral palsy.","authors":["K?roly Pap","S?ndor Kiss","Tibor V?zkelety","Gy?rgy Szoke"],"year":"2005","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"We reviewed radiographs of 76 hips in 41 patients with cerebral palsy treated with open adductor tenotomy because of hip subluxation.

Thus, the insertion of the osteosynthesis material during a varization osteotomy can be technical demanding. Risks and benefits of a modified femoral varization osteotomy were evaluated in a retrospective follow-up study. MATERIAL: 53 paralytic hips (33 patients) have been operated from September 1989 to april 1993. Mean age at surgery was 6 years. The etiologies were Spinal Amyotrophy in 12 hips, Cerebral Palsy in 31 hips and miscellaneous neurologic diseases in 10 hips. The average neck-shaft angle before surgery was 162 degrees. The mean Reimers' Index was 58 per cent. METHODS: The upper femoral shaft was exposed by subperiosteal dissection in a circumferential manner. An intertrochanteric osteotomy was carried out. The direction of the femoral neck was identified. An AO 100 degree blade plate was then introduced under direct visual control through the cancellous osteotomy surface of the proximal fragment. Radiological and clinical outcome were assessed at last follow-up. Mean follow-up was 16 months. RESULTS: Solid fusion was obtained in all patients. The mean postoperative neck-shaft angle was 104 degrees. The mean Reimers' Index was 17 per cent at last follow-up. Two infections were noted. Voluminous calcifications under the femoral neck have been observed in 6 cases. Recurrence of the valgus deformity was noted in 9 hips at last follow-up. DISCUSSION: This simplified varization technique permits a large amount of varization. The medialization diminishes the problem of protruding hardware. The complications rate appears to be low without any femoral head necrosis in this series despite subperiosteal dissection of the femoral neck. CONCLUSION: The authors think that this modified varization technique may deserve consideration in the treatment of the unstable paralytic hip.","tags":["Humans;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Surgical;","Dislocation;","Fixators;","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Retrospective","Bifida","Spinal","Palsy;","Female;","Spina","Atrophies","Occulta;","Studies;","Child;","Femur","Paralysis;","Muscular","Internal","Male;","Child,","of","Casts,","Childhood","Osteotomy;","Head;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2be8c96065ae0d541978b4bb1fb4e6b9c\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Effect of Glucosamine Sulfate on Hip Osteoarthritis","authors":["Rianne M Rozendaal","Bart W Koes","Gerjo J V M van Osch","Elian J Uitterlinden","Eric H Garling","Sten P Willemsen","Abida Z Ginai","Jan A N Verhaar","Harrie Weinans","Sita M A Bierma-Zeinstra"],"year":"2008","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Background: The effectiveness of glucosamine sulfate as a symptom and disease modifier for osteoarthritis is still under debate.Objective: To assess whether glucosamine sulfate has an effect on the symptoms and structural progression of hip osteoarthritis during 2 years of treatment.Design: Randomized, controlled trial.Setting: Primary care in the Netherlands.Patients: 222 patients with hip osteoarthritis who were recruited by their general practitioner.

Knees and ankles are subject to stress and, therefore, they assume compensating positions. Lower legs assume position of valgus and external rotation, whereas feet rotate either inwards or outwards. Secondary deformities make gait more difficult and cause rapid tear of footwear. AIM: The purpose of the paper was to retrospectively analyze the effects of transposition of the gluteus medius and minimus muscles, a procedure introduced for the first time in our country in order to correct the deformity. A new method of binding the muscles by wire was described. There had been no previous experience with this method. METHOD: This operation was indicated in patients with spastic form of cerebral palsy, who were able to walk, who had difficulties in gait and whose lateral rotation was less than 10 degrees along with the medial rotation of over 70 degrees of the hip on the side of the deformity. Additional prerequisite for the operation was the absence of flexion contracture of more than 15 degrees of either the hip or the knee on the side of deformity, as there is possibility of aggravation of the flexion hip deformity due to transposed gluteal muscles (now in front of the hip joint). Fifteen hips of 10 patients were operated on. Five patients were operated on bilaterally at one time. The average age was 8 (6-12) years. The majority of patients, 8 (80\\%) were aged between 6 and 8. The average follow-up was 5 years (3-8). The assessment of the results was based on the comparison of rotational abilities of both hips before and after the operation (in unilateral and bilateral deformities), as well as on individual complaints before and after the operation. In patients with unilateral deformity, their \"healthy\" hips were the control hips. The analysis of the femoral neck anteversion before and after operation was performed. RESULTS: Average values of medial and lateral rotation of the deformed hips before operation exhibited significant statistical difference when compared to control hips. The difference of average values of rotatory movements of control and operated hips was not statistically significant after operation. The difference of average preoperative values of the femoral neck anteversion in hips with deformity was statistically significant (49.40+\/-4.63 degrees compared to 32.8+\/-3.11 degrees ). Postoperative average values of anteversion in operated and control hips were not statistically significant. The difference between average preoperative (49.40+\/-4.63 degrees ) and postoperative (35.80+\/-7.66 degrees ) values of the femoral neck anteversion was statistically significant. Excellent results were achieved in 5 (50\\%) patients, i.e. 8 (53.3\\%) hips; good results were achieved in 3 (30\\%) patients, i.e. 5 (33.3\\%) hips; poor result in 2 (20\\%) patients, i.e. 2 (13.3\\%) hips. All 5 patients who had undergone surgery of both hips had symmetric outcome. Three patients had excellent results, while two had good results. Patients with excellent and good results (80\\% of patients, 86.6\\% of hips) showed neither weakening of the operated hip abduction nor pelvic instability (positive Trendelenburgh hip test). No complications were recorded postoperatively. CONCLUSION: Transposition of gluteal muscles can be recommended in patients under 10 years of age as there is still a chance for their femoral neck to change orientation, to decrease the anteversion and thus to achieve long-lasting effect. Fixation of transposed muscles by wire proved to be effective.","tags":["Muscle,","Child;","Humans;","Deformities,","Joint;","Acquired;","Palsy;","Cerebral","Buttocks;","Joint","Hip","Skeletal"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2d0222502109caf847aba23b01fc2e680\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"A tool for quantifying hip flexor function during gait.","authors":["M.

A single index number is derived that describes accurately the overall hip function. Initial clinical validation was carried out using a data set of 23 normal controls and six patients with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. The patients were all independent ambulators who had undergone orthopedic hip surgery. The controls were used to establish patterns of interdependency between selected gait parameters and form a basis for the index number. The HFI based surgical outcome was compared to the subjective rating of six clinicians. The clinicians were versed in gait analysis and were blinded to the HFI based outcome. The HFI measure of post-operative change in hip function was found to correspond well with the subjective clinical evaluation. A valid tool such as the HFI can be used to objectify clinical impressions of change in hip function, and can thereby assist researchers with statistical and outcome analysis of interdependent and redundant gait variables.","tags":["Muscle,","Child;","Humans;","Skeletal;","Kinetics;","Gait;","Palsy;","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Reference","Hip;","Values"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f3491e9bd63b1f10e8ac02e6417fd057\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"A radiological study of the hip joint in cerebral palsy","authors":["O.

In order to clarify the factors of tendency to dislocation, radiological survey was undertaken for the patients of CP.

One hundred seventy eight hips of 90 patients with an average of 26 years of age and 64 hips of normal individual as a control. Kai's method was used for measuring angles of tilting at neck and anteversion. The incidence of dislocations of the hip joints was more frequent in patients who were incapable of weight bearing than in patients who were capable of weight bearing (p < 0.01). However, there was no difference between spastic type and athetotic type of CP. In patients who were incapable of weight bearing inclination (the neck-shaft angle), anteversion of the femoral neck to the shaft showed larger than in patients who were capable of weight bearing (p < 0.01). Anteversion of patients who were capable of weight bearing of CP was larger than that of the normal control (p < 0.01), but extent of inclination was the same. From these findings the present investigator has concluded that femoral neck becomes valgus with an increased anteversion in longstanding CP patients who are especially unable to stand or walk.

The purpose of the paper is to present the results of an original method of precise determination of the degree of rotation for derotation femoral osteotomy. Indications for this operation were set in patients with spastic form of cerebral palsy over 10 years of age, able to walk, who had difficulties in gait and whose lateral rotation was less than 15 along with the medial rotation of over 70 in the hip on the side of the deformity. Twenty hips in 17 patients able to walk were operated on. The average age was 21 (11 - 42), the average follow-up was 11 years (3-17).

This study compares the radiographic anatomy of the hip in CP with normal values and suggests the cause of dislocation. The cases of CP were divided into three groups according to ambulation and dislocation: group 1 consisted of 111 hips in a total of 64 ambulatory children, group 2, 116 hips in 72 non-ambulatory children, and group 3, 37 hips including 13 dislocated hips and 24 subluxated hips in 32 children. Of these 37 hips, patients with a dislocated hip and 3 subluxated hips were ambulatory but the beginning of their independent walking was as late as 5 years of age or even later. The following results were obtained. Femoral antetorsion was markedly increased in CP, and the difference was statistically very significant for all groups 1, 2 and 3 (p less than 0.001, and p less than 0.01 between groups 1 and 2). In CP groups there was no regression with age. Significant increases in femoral inclination were found in CP groups (p less than 0.001). There was, however, no significant differences among groups 1, 2 and 3, and so the degree to which these were the cause for dislocation was less than that of femoral antetorsion. Significant shortness of the femoral neck was noted between groups 1 and 3 (p less than 0.01), with significant regression with age in all CP groups. The mean value of the acetabular index in group 3 was 34.5 +\/- 5.9, which was significantly higher than in group 1, and group 2 (p less than 0.001). In groups 2 and 3 there was no regression with age. Thus dislocation and subluxation of the hip in CP can be caused by the increase of antetorsion of the femur and acetabular dysplasia and depend on the ability of walking.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Neck;","Acetabulum;","Gait;","Factors;","Femur","Joint;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Dislocation;","Male","Preschool;","Locomotion;","Hip","Child,","Infant;","Palsy;","Female;","Age"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2f91ae19600b2744392ea13d43071d014\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Quantitative analysis of hip dysplasia in cerebral palsy: a study of radiographs and 3-D reformatted images.","authors":["M.

Using a supervised algorithm and a clinically well-defined cohort of 131 cases, we built a unique 20-miRNA metastasis signature that could significantly predict (P < 0.001) primary HCC tissues with venous metastases from metastasis-free solitary tumors with 10-fold cross-validation.

It inhibits motor development and is also a risk factor for hip dislocation. Botulinum toxin has been found to be an effective means of treating spastic pes equinus in walking cerebral palsy patients and could have other indications. We conducted a prospective study to determine the functional and orthopedic contribution of botulinum toxin in the treatment of spastic hip adductors in non-ambulatory cerebral palsy children.MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 11 quadriplegic children with cerebral palsy (mean age 5 years 9 months). Seven of the children had unilateral migration of the hip at study onset (> 40\\% radiographically). The children were given a single injection of botulinum toxin (Dysport: 20 units\/kg\/hip) in the adductor muscles (21 treated hips). The children were seen again at months 1, 3, 6 and 12 after treatment (with the exception of one patient not seen after the 6(th) month at the request of the parents). Spasticity was measured with the modified Ashworth scale. The motor level was determined with 8 position and motor items and with the GMFCS classification. Hip x-rays were obtained at study onset and once or twice during the follow-up.RESULTS: There were no adverse effects of the treatment. Spasticity decreased by one point or more on the Ashworth scale in 20 hips at month 1 and remained low at month 3 in 14, and at month 6 in 12 of the 21 hips treated. The effect of the anti-spasticity treatment faded out from the 6(th) to the 12(th) month. Three children who experienced pain in the lower limbs were definitively relieved after treatment. Nine children achieved functional improvement (progress in at least one of the motor items). Three children were able to walk with a walker and two of them improved from level IV to level III on the GMFCS. The best functional responses appeared to occur in the younger children and in those who had good results at months 3 and 6. Among the 7 children whose hip was displaced by more than 40\\%, 5 had an unfavorable radiological progression and underwent surgery.DISCUSSION: This study demonstrates that the botulinum toxin can be effective against spasticity of the hip adductors and that its effect is still significant 6 months after the injection in more than half the hips treated. It has an analgesic effect. This treatment has a functional impact even in children with severe motor impairment. The benefit has been modest but three children were able to progress to walking with a walker. The best functional results were observed in the younger children and in those whose spasticity had declined at month 3 and 6. It could thus be favored either by innate potential for motor development or by the treatment itself. The botulinum toxin did not improve the orthopedic prognosis of the children: 5 of the 7 with a risk of luxation worsened. Nevertheless, our study suggests that the botulinum toxin is a well-tolerated anti-spasticity treatment that is effective for the hip adductors providing an important contribution to the management of non-ambulatory cerebral palsy children.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Toxins;","Hip;","Spasticity;","Quadriplegia","Preschool;","Child,","Palsy;","Female;","Prospective","Muscle","Studies;","Botulinum"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ae9933a0fa2799907534a4f76cf8bbc3\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Resection arthroplasty of the hip for patients with cerebral palsy: an outcome study.","authors":["R.

The average age at surgery was 26.6 years (range, 10.7-45.5 years), and average follow-up was 7.4 years (range, 2.2-20.8 years). All patients\/caregivers noted significant improvement in subjective assessment of pain after the surgery. Upright sitting tolerance improved from an average preoperative value of 3.2-8.9 h postoperatively (p < 0.01). Four patients who were unable even to sit in a customized wheelchair before the operation could be easily seated in a custom chair after surgery. Hip range of motion including flexion, extension, and abduction was significantly improved postoperatively (p < 0.05). Single-dose radiation therapy was used postoperatively for five hips and resulted in a significantly lower grade of heterotopic ossification at final follow-up (p < 0.005). Skeletal traction in the postoperative period did not prevent proximal migration of the femur compared with skin traction. Maximal pain relief was achieved at an average of 5.6 months postoperatively (range, 0.03-14 months). Complications included transient postoperative decubitus ulceration (four patients), pneumonia (two patients), and symptomatic heterotopic bone (two patients). The significant improvements in pain management, sitting tolerance, and range of motion suggest that PFRIA is a reasonable salvage procedure for the painful, dislocated hip in cerebral palsy.

The applicable conditions of the SPCEI were then investigated, and the results showed that the SPCEI was suitable for dryland crops under non-irrigated conditions in arid and semi-arid areas. The difference between the SPEI and SPCEI is analysed. Compared with the SPEI, the SPCEI considers crop evapotranspiration and the crop growth stage and was found to be more suitable for monitoring agricultural drought. Qigihar, which is located in a semi-arid area in western Heilongjiang Province, China, was then analysed as an example. The characteristics of the spatial and temporal variability of regional agricultural drought were analysed based on maize and soybean in dryland areas. The results for the different growth stages of maize and soybean showed that drought intensity is more serious in the initial stage in the middle part. In crop development, mid-season and late season stage, the drought conditions gradually increased from north to south. The drought degree of the two crops at the initial stage gradually increased, and the drought degree at the crop development stage gradually decreased. The main reason is that precipitation gradually increases during the crop development stage.","tags":["crops,","droughts,"],"url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/hyp.13365","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/23fe3c2029f4746129c0ffe14730585b7\/rutgerdankers","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Constrained differential renormalization of Yang-Mills theories","authors":["M.

However, the choice of the threshold remains an important question without definite answers and common visual diagnostic tools are difficult to reproduce on a large scale. This study investigates the behaviour of some automatic methods for threshold selection based on the generalized Pareto model for flood peak exceedances of the threshold and the Anderson\u2013Darling test for fitting this model. In particular, the choice of a critical significance level to define an interval of acceptable values is addressed. First, automatic methods are investigated using a simulation study to assess fitting and prediction performance in a controlled environment. It is shown that P values approximated by an existing table of critical values can speed up computation without affecting the quality of the outcomes. Second, a case study compares automatically and manually selected thresholds for 285 sites across Canada by flood regime and super regions based on site characteristics. Correspondences are examined in terms of prediction of flood quantiles and trend analysis. Results show that trend detection is sensitive to the threshold selection method when studying the evolution of the number of peaks per year. Finally, a hybrid method is developed to combine automatic methods and is calibrated on the basis of super regions. The outcomes of the hybrid method are shown to more closely reproduce the estimates of the manually selected thresholds while reducing the model uncertainty.","tags":["floods,","extremes,","statistics"],"url":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/abs\/10.1002\/hyp.13223","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2999bd9aee3a196c8d6a14dcf44856440\/rutgerdankers","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Regional extreme dry spell frequency analysis using the L-moments method in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin, China","authors":["Dun-Xian She","Jun Xia","Dan Zhang","Ai-Zhong Ye","Aditya Sood"],"year":"2013","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"In this research, regional extreme dry spell frequency in the middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) is studied by the L-moments method. The research area has been divided into three sub-regions (Region1, Region2 and Region3), which have been identified as homogenous regions. The results of goodness-of-fit test indicate that Generalized Normal Distribution (GNO) is the optimal regional model for Region 1 and Region2 while Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) is the optimal regional model for Region3. The return period analysis figures out that maximum length of dry spell (MxDS) values increase from south to north in the southern part and increase from northeast to southwest in the northern part of the middle reaches of the YRB under different return periods. The increments of quantiles of dry spell under different return levels indicate that drought risk in Region1 is higher than that in Region2 and Region3. The analysis of the occurrence day of MxDS shows that MxDS mostly occurred during winter of 1998 and spring of 1999 in most stations during the considered period. By comparing summer MxDS events, it can be found that mean MxDS values have slightly increased in Region1 and Region2 during the last five decades. The maximum mean MxDS values are appeared in 2000s, 2000s and 1990s for Region1, Region2 and Region3, respectively.

A peaks-over-threshold model is developed for the extreme daily areal rainfall occurrence and magnitude in the fall over six Mediterranean catchments in Southern France. The main driver of the heavy rainfall events observed in this region is the humidity flux from the Mediterranean Sea. Reanalysis data are used to compute the daily humidity flux (FHUM) during the period 1958\u20132008, to be included as a covariate in the model parameters. Results indicate that the introduction of FHUM as a covariate in the model parameters can improve the modelling of extreme areal precipitation. The seasonal average of FHUM can improve the modelling of the seasonal occurrences of heavy rainfall events, while the daily FHUM values can improve the modelling of the events magnitudes. In addition, an ensemble of simulations produced by five different general circulation models are used to compute FHUM in future climate and hence to evaluate the impact of climate change on the heavy rainfall distribution in the selected catchments. This ensemble of climate models allows the evaluation of the uncertainties of climate projections. By comparison to the reference period 1960\u20131990, all models projects an amplification of mean seasonal FHUM from the Mediterranean Sea during the projection period 2070\u20132099, on average by +22%. This increase in the humidity flux leads to an increase in the number of heavy rainfall events, from an ensemble average of 2.55 events during the fall season in present climate to 3.57 events projected for the period 2070\u20132099. However, the projected changes have limited impacts on the magnitude of extreme events, with a 5% increase in the median of 100-year quantiles.

Providing an accurate estimate of future changes to such extreme events due to climate change are crucial for responsible decision making in flood risk management given the predictive uncertainties. The objective of this article is to provide a comparison of dynamically downscaled climate models simulations from multiple model including 12 different combinations of General Circulation Model (GCM)\u2013regional climate model (RCM), which offers an abundance of additional data sets. The three major aspects of this study include the bias correction of RCM scenarios, the application of a newly developed performance metric and the extreme value analysis of future precipitation. The dynamically downscaled data sets reveal a positive overall bias that is removed through quantile mapping bias correction method. The added value index was calculated to evaluate the models' simulations. Results from this metric reveal that not all of the RCMs outperform their host GCMs in terms of correlation skill. Extreme value theory was applied to both historic, 1980\u20131998, and future, 2038\u20132069, daily data sets to provide estimates of changes to 2- and 25-year return level precipitation events. The generalized Pareto distribution was used for this purpose. The Willamette River basin was selected as the study region for analysis because of its topographical variability and tendency for significant precipitation. The extreme value analysis results showed significant differences between model runs for both historical and future periods with considerable spatial variability in precipitation extremes.

This\nfinding demonstrates that entropy-like information measures may themselves be\nunderstood as the result of a minimization process on a more general underlying\nmathematical structure, thus providing an entirely new interpretational\nframework to entropy-like measures of information and entanglement. We suggest\nthree natural axioms for defining tree structures, which turn out to be related\nto the axioms describing neighbourhood topologies on a topological space.

Treatment of crouch gait is challenging, at present, because the factors that contribute to hip and knee extension during normal gait are not well understood, and because the potential of individual muscles to produce flexion or extension of the joints during stance is unknown. This study analyzed a three-dimensional, muscle-actuated dynamic simulation of walking to quantify the angular accelerations of the hip and knee induced by muscles during normal gait, and to rank the potential of the muscles to alter motions of these joints. Examination of the muscle actions during single limb stance showed that the gluteus maximus, vasti, and soleus make substantial contributions to hip and knee extension during normal gait. Per unit force, the gluteus maximus had greater potential than the vasti to accelerate the knee toward extension. These data suggest that weak hip extensors, knee extensors, or ankle plantar flexors may contribute to crouch gait, and strengthening these muscles--particularly gluteus maximus--may improve hip and knee extension. Abnormal forces generated by the iliopsoas or adductors may also contribute to crouch gait, as our analysis showed that these muscles have the potential to accelerate the hip and knee toward flexion. This work emphasizes the need to consider how muscular forces contribute to multijoint movements when attempting to identify the causes of abnormal gait.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Knee","Acceleration;","Joint;","Gait","Cerebral","Biomechanics;","Hip","Skeletal","Muscle,","Palsy;","Biological;","Neurologic;","Models,","Disorders,"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.jbiomech.2004.09.036","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2aed3cbf8d9e6fd808178f0a539b61507\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Management of hip posture in cerebral palsy.","authors":["A.

The mean annual precipitation at the site was over 1900 mm. The field capacity was approximately 0\u00b753 m3 m\u22123 and was nearly uniform with soil depth. Soil moisture decreased at all levels during the dry season, with the minimum of 0\u00b738 m3 m\u22123 at 3 m beneath the surface. The moisture in the upper 1 m showed a strong diel cycle with daytime depletion due to evapotranspiration. The moisture beneath 1 m declined during both day and night due to the combined effects of evapotranspiration, drainage and a nighttime upward movement of water. The depth of active water withdrawal changed markedly over the year. The upper 2 m of soil supplied \u223c56\\% of the water used for evapotranspiration in the wet season and \u223c28\\% of the water used in the dry season. The zone of active water withdrawal extended to a depth of at least 10 m. The day-to-day rates of moisture withdrawal from the upper 10 m of soil during rain-free periods agreed well with simultaneous measurements of whole-forest evapotranspiration made by the eddy covariance technique. The forest at the site was well adapted to the normal cycle of wet and dry seasons, and the dry season had only a small effect on the rates of land\u2013atmosphere water vapour exchange.

The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) is the nonparametric Bayesian equivalent of an HMM. However, HDP-HMM is restricted to an ergodic topology and uses a Dirichlet Process Model (DPM) to achieve a mixture distribution-like model. For applications such as speech recognition, where we deal with ordered sequences, it is desirable to impose a left-to-right structure on the model to improve its ability to model the sequential nature of the speech signal. In this paper, we introduce three enhancements to HDP-HMM: (1) a left-to-right structure: needed for sequential decoding of speech, (2) non-emitting initial and final states: required for modeling finite length sequences, (3) HDP mixture emissions: allows sharing of data across states. The latter is particularly important for speech recognition because Gaussian mixture models have been very effective at modeling speaker variability. Further, due to the nature of language, some models occur infrequently and have a small number of data points associated with them, even for large corpora. Sharing allows these models to be estimated more accurately. We demonstrate that this new HDP-HMM model produces a 15% increase in likelihoods and a 15% relative reduction in error rate on a phoneme classification task based on the TIMIT Corpus.","tags":["processes;non-parametric","modeling;Data","Markov","initial","processes;decoding;hidden","Bayesian","methods;Computational","Bayes","Corpus;data","recognition;Topology;hidden","models;phoneme","length","Model;Gaussian","models;Speech;Speech","states;finite","models;hierarchical","structure;mixture","classification","points;ergodic","model;nonemitting","speech","models;speech","sequences;hierarchical","methods;Gaussian","recognition;speech","hidden","recognition","topology;final","mixture","Process","signal;Bayes","emissions;HDP-HMM;TIMIT","framework;DPM;Dirichlet","states;nonparametric","models;Hidden","task;sequential","model;left-to-right","decoding;speaker","Dirichlet","models;HDP","nature;sequential","variability;speech","distribution-like","models;mixture","recognition;Bayesian"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22f448021b97ed3124fad5f8509944eb1\/templehpc","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Transmission Power Control in Single-hop and Multi-hop Wireless Sensor Networks","authors":["Mahir Meghji","Daryoush Habibi"],"year":"2011","editors":null,"isbn":"978-3-642-23794-2","publisher":"Springer-Verlag","abstract":"A major challenge in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployment is to minimize sensor node's energy consumption to prolong the lifetime of the finite-capacity batteries.

We offer a new approach to test TPC in multihop networks at the physical layer, and provide energy consumption performance results via simulation and numerical model. Our simulation and numerical model results illustrate that energy spent to send packets using short-range multi-hop path instead of single-hop does not necessarily save energy as suggested by some of the earlier research.

Antecedent conditions and time-lag of catchments were accounted for in calculating the indicators on a range of durations up to 30 days preceding a flood. Relationships between flood occurrence on 488 river basins and CTCs were explored using 73 catalogues developed within COST733 Action, all defined from automatic algorithms using ERA-40 data. Results showed that at the river basin scale, some CTs have significant, positive frequency anomalies with flood occurrence. At the scale of Europe, the same CTs showed the strongest links with flood occurrence. The number of classes of CTCs is of lesser importance than the algorithm used, and depending whether global frequency or persistence of CT was analysed could give contrasting results. Results obtained from an automatically derived Grosswetterlagen classification were consistent with previous research, but performance was lower than that of other automatic algorithms (e.g. WLKC and SANDRAS).

It enhances the original Internet architecture by injecting a new thin layer between the IP layer and the transport protocols. This new layer introduces a new name space consisting of cryptographic identifiers, thereby implementing the so-called identifier \/ locator split. In the new architecture, the new identifiers are used for naming application level end-points, thereby taking the prior identification role of IP addresses in applications, sockets, TCP connections, and UDP send and receive system calls. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are still used, but only as names for topological locations in the network. At the same time, due to the backwards compatibility mode, no changes are needed in applications. The architectural enhancement implemented by HIP has profound consequences. A number of the previously hard problems become suddenly much easier. Mobility, multi-homing, and baseline end-to-end security integrate neatly into the architecture. The use of cryptographic identifiers allows enhanced accountability, thereby providing a base for easier build up of trust. With some privacy enhancements, HIP allows good location anonymity, assuring strong identity only towards relevant trusted parties. Finally, the HIP protocol has been carefully designed to take middle boxes into account, providing for overlay networks and thereby helping to reduce the currently prevalent problems with bad traffic and routing scalability. This tutorial provides an in-depth look at HIP, discussing its architecture, design, benefits, and potential drawbacks. In the first part of the tutorial, the architecture and design of HIP is discussed in an interactive but lecture-like manner.

In situ soil moisture measurements collected during the period from January 2003 through February 2006 and for depths ranging from 10 to 1,430\u00a0cm suggest that, in the study site, the top 480\u00a0cm of the soil profile satisfied most of the transpirational demands in normal climatological years. However, during exceptionally dry periods, such as the 2005 drought, root uptake occurs below 480\u00a0cm.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: 76 children, 42 with spastic quadriplegia and 34 with diplegia, were included in the study. Their mean age at the first radiographic examination was 3.5 (1-11) years. The patients were followed up until operative treatment (54 subjects) or until the most recent radiograph in those who did not undergo hip surgery. The mean length of follow-up was 4.8 (1-13) years. On the initial and most recent radiographs, the migration percentage (MP) was measured, which is the percentage of the femoral head lateral to the acetabular rim. RESULTS: The mean MP of the side with the largest displacement was 25\\% (-18-66) at the initial radiographic examination and 51\\% (9-100) at the last follow-up. The mean increase in MP was 7\\% (-2-33) per year. Linear multiple regression revealed that gait function and age were the most important variables that influenced the rate of MP progression. Children who could not walk had significantly greater MP progression per year (12\\%) than those who walked with or without support (2\\%). In the quadriplegics, the maximal yearly increase in MP was 13\\% under 5 years of age and 7\\% in older children. This difference was statistically significant, whereas no significant difference in relation to patient age was seen in the diplegics. INTERPRETATION: There is a pronounced trend towards displacement of the hips in quadriplegic CP patients who are under 5 years of age and cannot walk. Because hip dislocation may lead to severe problems, close follow-up is important in finding the appropriate time for hip surgery in order to avoid progression towards dislocation. The risk of severe hip dysplasia is considerably less in spastic diplegia.","tags":["Factors","Child;","Humans;","Gait;","Joint;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocation;","Risk","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Child,","Quadriplegia;","Infant;","Palsy;","Female;","Studies;"],"url":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1080\/17453670610045803","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2466ed2b012ae0d4ca0ac7eafb5dd54cd\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Palliative Schanz osteotomy for irreducible hip dislocation in adolescent patients with cerebral palsy","authors":["A.

MATERIAL: In 1992 to 2002, Schanz osteotomy was indicated on 46 occasions in 27 nonambulatory patients with the quadriplegic form of cerebral palsy aged 9 to 18 years. METHODS: In the postoperative evaluation, emphasis was placed on the clinical presentation, i.e., improved motion of the hip joints and pain alleviation.

Schanz angulation osteotomy can provide a better range of motion, alleviate pain and facilitate the care of patients, particularly if they are nonambulatory.

Finally, we discuss the possible periodic conditions that can be\nimposed on the generators of the algebra and generalize the spectral flow\nanalysed previously in the context of the \\$N\\$-extended linear superconformal\nalgebras with \\$N 4\\$. The \\$(2+1)\\$-AdS\/2-CFT correspondence sheds a new\nlight on the properties of the nonlinear superconformal algebras.

Detailed analysis covered a patient's function, occurrence and intensity of pain in the hip joint, value of radiological parameters such as angle of centre-edge of the roof after Wiberg (CE), acetabular index (AI), neck-shaft angle (NS) and migration percentage (MP). The final evaluation of radiological results was carried out in accordance with Severin's classification. The clinical and radiological results obtained showed gradual deteriorations in comparison with the early postoperative results (dating from 12 months after surgery). In the final examination, in one patient a recurrent dislocation of the hip joint was diagnosed and subluxation was diagnosed in six patients (23\\%). Only the values of the CE angle went up (from -16 degrees in the early postoperative examination to 20 degrees in the final assessment), which we consider to be due to the change of sphericity of the head of femur. The remaining radiological parameters did not change significantly: AI from 22 degrees to 23 degrees, MP from 11\\% to 23\\%, NS from 133 degrees to 140 degrees. The surgical method presented is currently applied in a modified form, with a wider release within the soft tissues, more radical varusderotation osteotomy and greater shortening of the femur.","tags":["Child;","Humans;","Adolescent;","Cerebral","Male;","Dislocation;","Ilium;","Measurement;","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Child,","Pain","Palsy;","Female;","Outcome","Treatment","Studies;","Osteotomy;"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/24e2ec799368d51990de8d8ff9a5be775\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Quantum Hall states as matrix Chern-Simons theory","authors":["Alexios P.

Annual percent BMD change per SD decrease was associated with risk of hip fracture (hazard ratio HR, 1.43 95% CI, 1.16 to 1.78) and major osteoporotic fracture (HR, 1.21 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.45) after adjusting for baseline BMD. At 10 years' follow-up, 1 SD decrease in annual percent BMD change compared with the mean BMD change was associated with 3.9 excess hip fractures per 100 persons. In receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses, the addition of BMD change to a model with baseline BMD did not meaningfully improve performance. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.71 (95% CI, 0.65 to 0.78) for the baseline BMD model compared with 0.68 (95% CI, 0.62 to 0.75) for the BMD percent change model. Moreover, the addition of BMD change to a model with baseline BMD did not meaningfully improve performance (AUC, 0.72 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.79). Using the net reclassification index, a second BMD measure increased the proportion of participants reclassified as high risk of hip fracture by 3.9% (95% CI, -2.2% to 9.9%), whereas it decreased the proportion classified as low risk by -2.2% (95% CI, -4.5% to 0.1%).In untreated men and women of mean age 75 years, a second BMD measure after 4 years did not meaningfully improve the prediction of hip or major osteoporotic fracture. Repeating a BMD measure within 4 years to improve fracture risk stratification may not be necessary in adults this age untreated for osteoporosis.","tags":["bone_mineral_density","screening","osteoporosis"],"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/24065012","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/295895cde02d455ee2811c0a15e7e8528\/iskanbasal","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Hip pain in 234 non-ambulatory adolescents and young adults with cerebral palsy: a cross-sectional multicentre study.","authors":["I.

Assessments consisted of hip radiographs in the standard position, a parental questionnaire, and a sleep chart, which was completed by parents every Friday night during the trial. Three children could not enter the trial because of general sleep problems, and three could not complete it because they were unable to sleep with the system. One further child withdrew from the study just before the end because of unacceptable deterioration for which surgery was needed. The remaining seven children completed the trial and there was an overall improvement in rate of hip migration percentage on the right from 7\\% per annum in the baseline period to 4\\% with the system (p<0.05).

The aims of the study were to monitor hip development by serial X-rays; to record gross locomotor development, aspects of physical management, and any hip-related orthotics or surgery; to learn more of the natural history of hip development in this condition; and to provide guidelines for a surveillance protocol for those clinically managing children with bilateral CP. Children were X-rayed at 18, 24, 30, 48, and 60 months. X-rays were taken in a standardized position and measured to record migration percentage, acetabular index, Sharp's angle, and Smith's diaphyseal ratios. Relationships between the measures were investigated and a natural history of the children's hip development suggested. At as early as 18 months, migration percentages were significantly greater than in the normally developing population, although no measured CP factor could be identified to be the cause of this early change. Two possible factors affecting early hip development are described, neither of which is clinically apparent: the first separates the bilateral CP population as a whole from the normal population; but there is an additional presdisposing factor affecting some children only which in the presence of the motor disorder, has a significant influence on early hip development and subsequent dysplasia. The study confirms that, when measured correctly, migration percentage is the best guide to hip surveillance and the need for treatment. It is suggested that all children with bilateral CP should be X-rayed in a standardized position at 30 months (corrected for gestational age).","tags":["Humans;","Joint;","Comorbidity;","Gait","Cerebral","Dislocation;","Male","Preschool;","Follow-Up","Hip","Child,","England;","Infant;","Palsy;","Cohort","Female;","Incidence;","Neurologic;","Studies;","Disorders,"],"url":"","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/20cfd3bb947d915c5a3e7ac6859358a19\/ar0berts","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"D-branes, B fields, and Ext groups","authors":["A.

DESIGN: Quality of life survey with the time trade off technique. The technique derives an estimate of preference for health states by finding the point at which respondents show no preference between a longer but lower quality of life and a shorter time in full health. SETTING: A randomised trial of external hip protectors for older women at risk of hip fracture. PARTICIPANTS: 194 women aged >\/= 75 years enrolled in the randomised controlled trial or who were eligible for the trial but refused completed a quality of life interview face to face. OUTCOME MEASURES: Respondents were asked to rate their own health by using the Euroqol instrument and then rate three health states (fear of falling, a \"good\" hip fracture, and a \"bad\" hip fracture) by using time trade off technique. RESULTS: On an interval scale between 0 (death) and 1 (full health), a \"bad\" hip fracture (which results in admission to a nursing home) was valued at 0.05; a \"good\" hip fracture (maintaining independent living in the community) 0.31, and fear of falling 0.67. Of women surveyed, 80% would rather be dead (utility=0) than experience the loss of independence and quality of life that results from a bad hip fracture and subsequent admission to a nursing home. The differences in mean utility weights between the trial groups and the refusers were not significant. A test-retest study on 36 women found that the results were reliable with correlation coefficients within classes ranging from 0.61 to 0.88. CONCLUSIONS: Among older women who have exceeded average life expectancy, quality of life is profoundly threatened by falls and hip fractures. Older women place a very high marginal value on their health. Any loss of ability to live independently in the community has a considerable detrimental effect on their quality of life.","tags":["fear","management","fracture","women","qol","older","hip"],"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve\\&db=pubmed\\&dopt=Abstract\\&list_uids=10657327","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2dd346262650941f0b1fb453d6dc40508\/willwade","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Evaluation and treatment of hip dysplasia in cerebral palsy.","authors":["David A Spiegel","John M Flynn"],"year":"2006","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"Hip problems, including progressive subluxation, dislocation, and pain, are common in patients with cerebral palsy, particularly those who are nonambulatory with a large degree of spasticity.

To evaluate this technique for predicting hip fracture in older men and women, we performed a nested age- and sex-matched case-control study in the Age Gene\/Environment Susceptibility (AGES) Reykjavik cohort. Baseline (pre-fracture) QCT scans of 5500 subjects were obtained. During 4-7\u00a0years follow-up, 51 men and 77 women sustained hip fractures. Ninety-seven men and 152 women were randomly selected as age- and sex-matched controls. FE-strength of the left hip of each subject for stance (FStance) and posterolateral fall (FFall) loading, and total femur areal bone mineral density (aBMD) were computed from the QCT data. FStance and FFall in incident hip fracture subjects were 13%-25% less than in control subjects (p\u00a0<=\u00a00.006) after controlling for demographic parameters. The difference between FE strengths of fracture and control subjects was disproportionately greater in men (stance, 22%; fall, 25%) than in women (stance, 13%; fall, 18%) (p\u00a0<=\u00a00.033), considering that FStance and FFall in fracture subjects were greater in men than in women (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). For men, FStance was associated with hip fracture after accounting for aBMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013). These data indicate that FStance provides information about fracture risk that is beyond that provided by aBMD (p\u00a0=\u00a00.013).

Experimental evidence is provided in to support of these conclusions. The tests showed that the superiority of the multi-hop scheme depends on the source-sink distance and reception cost. They also demonstrated that the two- hop strategy is most energy efficient when the relay is at the midpoint of the total transmission radius. Our results may be used in existing routing protocols to select optimal relays or to determine whether it is better to send packets directly to the base station or through intermediate nodes.","tags":["Comparison","Efficiency","One-Hop","WSNs","Routing","Energy","Multi-Hop"],"url":"http:\/\/ieeexplore.ieee.org\/xpl\/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4224134&queryText=transmission%20power%20and%20routing%20in%20WSNs&pageNumber=4&newsearch=true&searchField=Search_All","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/22431f5f42e573296bc1949cc008de94c\/dkafetzis","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Top quark physics at the LHC","authors":["Werner Bernreuther"],"year":"2008","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":null,"tags":["top","review","theory"],"url":"http:\/\/inspirehep.net\/record\/785441\/export\/hx","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2b3f5a1fddbb44e466e9c650a78eaa14f\/clange","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Exclusive Baryonic B Decays Circa 2005","authors":["Hai-Yang Cheng"],"year":"2006","editors":null,"isbn":null,"publisher":null,"abstract":"The status of exclusive two-body and three-body baryonic B decays is\nreviewed.

There is a paucity of research on antipsychotic efficacy against the primary negative symptoms, particularly in first-episode psychosis (FEP). We undertook a prospective, open-label pilot trial to investigate the use of amisulpride in the treatment of young people with FEP characterised by primary negative symptoms. METHOD: Twelve male and two female first-episode patients with primary negative symptoms (aged 16-26) were commenced on low-dose amisulpride (mean 250 mg\/day) and followed-up over a 6-month period. Primary outcome measures were the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Quality of Life Survey (QLS) and their respective subscales. RESULTS: For the 12 completers there was a statistically significant improvement in SANS summary score (p = 0.036), Affective Flattening subscale global score (p = 0.046), QLS total score (p = 0.021), QLS subscales of Instrumental Role (p = 0.018) and Intra-psychic Foundations (p = 0.009) from baseline to week 24. CONCLUSIONS: Amisulpride appears to be associated with less severe negative symptoms and improved quality of life.

Objectives: Comparison of hip joint moments, power and mechanical work on the prosthetic limb of a transfemoral amputee calculated by inverse dynamics using either the ground reactions (force-plates) or knee reactions (transducer). Study design: Comparative analysis. Methods: Kinematics, ground reaction and knee reaction data were collected using a motion analysis system, two force-plates, and a multi-axial transducer mounted below the socket, respectively. Results: The inverse dynamics using ground reaction underestimated the peaks of hip energy generation and absorption occurring at 63% and 76% of the gait cycle (GC) by 28% and 54%, respectively. This method also overestimated by 24% a phase of negative work at the hip (37%-56% GC), and underestimated the phases of positive (57%-72% GC) and negative (73%-98%GC) work at the hip by 11% and 58%, respectively. Conclusions: A transducer mounted within the prosthesis has the capacity to provide more realistic kinetics of the prosthetic limb because it enables assessment of multiple consecutive steps and a wide range of activities without the issue of foot placement on force-plates. Clinical relevance The hip is the only joint an amputee controls directly to set the prosthesis in motion. Hip joint kinetics are associated with joint degeneration, low back pain, risk of falls, etc. Therefore, realistic assessment of hip kinetics over multiple gait cycles and a wide range of activities is essential.","tags":["joint","Prostheses","moments","Amputation","Transcutaneous","Intraosseous","osseointegration","hip"],"url":"http:\/\/poi.sagepub.com\/content\/35\/2\/140.abstract","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/276f2568cb895b51a893ae2c8f512befb\/bunke","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"The energy cost of walking with arthritis of the hip and knee.","authors":["R.

Nine patients were tested following Girdlestone hip resection arthroplasty, six patients prior to total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for unilateral osteoarthritis of the knee, and 49 rheumatoid arthritis patients prior to unilateral TKA; 27 were retested after operation. The results were compared with previously published pre- and postoperative data for total hip arthroplasty (THA) following primary osteoarthritis. There were severe energetic penalties caused by rheumatoid or osteoarthritis involving the hip or knee or following Girdlestone arthroplasty. Walking speed was severely reduced in all groups (range, 33-46 m\/minute). The rate of oxygen consumption was not significantly greater than the mean rate of oxygen uptake for normal subjects; however, the oxygen cost per meter travelled was elevated because of the slow walking speed. The heart rate was significantly elevated in all patient groups. The elevated cardiac response can be accounted for on the basis of deconditioning resulting from the patients' pain, limited ambulatory activities, and the systemic effects of rheumatoid disease. In addition, the elevated cardiac response may be caused by added physical exertion by the arms in patients on crutches or walkers. The improvements in speed and energy cost were the same for the group of rheumatoid patients tested after unilateral TKA as in the group of patients tested before and after THA. The clinician can anticipate the same magnitude of improvement from surgery in a rheumatoid patient as in an osteoarthritis patient if the primary joint disease is restricted to a single joint.","tags":["energy","crutches","arthritis"],"url":"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve\\&db=pubmed\\&dopt=Abstract\\&list_uids=3791753","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/2ed17b133d811a8f4ab8e27b5fa8cdbe2\/willwade","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"A general method for determining the masses of semi-\r\n                  invisibly decaying particles at hadron colliders","authors":["Konstantin T.

The main conclusions are as follows. 1) Larger, more\ncapable computing and data facilities are needed to support HEP science goals\nin all three frontiers: Energy, Intensity, and Cosmic. The expected scale of\nthe demand at the 2025 timescale is at least two orders of magnitude -- and in\nsome cases greater -- than that available currently. 2) The growth rate of data\nproduced by simulations is overwhelming the current ability, of both facilities\nand researchers, to store and analyze it. Additional resources and new\ntechniques for data analysis are urgently needed. 3) Data rates and volumes\nfrom HEP experimental facilities are also straining the ability to store and\nanalyze large and complex data volumes. Appropriately configured\nleadership-class facilities can play a transformational role in enabling\nscientific discovery from these datasets. 4) A close integration of HPC\nsimulation and data analysis will aid greatly in interpreting results from HEP\nexperiments. Such an integration will minimize data movement and facilitate\ninterdependent workflows. 5) Long-range planning between HEP and ASCR will be\nrequired to meet HEP's research needs. To best use ASCR HPC resources the\nexperimental HEP program needs a) an established long-term plan for access to\nASCR computational and data resources, b) an ability to map workflows onto HPC\nresources, c) the ability for ASCR facilities to accommodate workflows run by\ncollaborations that can have thousands of individual members, d) to transition\ncodes to the next-generation HPC platforms that will be available at ASCR\nfacilities, e) to build up and train a workforce capable of developing and\nusing simulations and analysis to support HEP scientific research on\nnext-generation systems.","tags":["hpc,","review"],"url":"http:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1603.09303","id":"https:\/\/www.bibsonomy.org\/bibtex\/214706278965132dedaa68425db6d753a\/cmcneile","type":"Publication","search term":"Hip Hop"},{"title":"Superpartner mass measurements with 1D decomposed MT2","authors":["Partha Konar","Kyoungchul Kong","Konstantin T.
